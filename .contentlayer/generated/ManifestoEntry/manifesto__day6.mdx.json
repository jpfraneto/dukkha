The commitment will be established with time, and with the willingness to Do The Work. To sit. To go for it. That is the entrance ticket that will allow you to get into this world. The tickets won’t have a prize associated with them, the prize will be what you will go through in each stage of the journey. And we will be there, next to you. It is going to be the most important 3 weeks of your life. The most transformational ones. And we will be there, holding space for that to happen. Until eventually we have all gone through it. It is the initiation ritual, the step into another stage of being. And no money can pay for that, because it can’t be prohibitive. No one can stay out of it for not having the means. It should be the other way around, people should pay to the ones that are going through the process, because it is going to require their whole being. And the ideal thing is that they don’t have to deal with the daily stuff that shows up and makes life be what it is. This program is something that is out of life, because it is a transition into something beyond. And a key component to it is that it is not paid beforehand. Yes, it may have to be paid afterwards, we can arrange how that will be worked out, but the most important thing of the whole project is that each person can go through the transformational journey without having to pay anything more than the time that she will spend Doing The Work. That is all what it takes.\n",

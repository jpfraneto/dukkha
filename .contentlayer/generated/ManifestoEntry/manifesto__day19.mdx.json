    "raw": "\nDepression is probably the human condition that amazes me the most. The one that I think is most important to tackle on this day and age, because it is also one of the most prevailing ones. And I can see the way out of how present it is, and that is not by forcing children to use social media in a different way, its about creating new conditions and new options that are better than that.\n\nEvery time that willpower is the way to go, it ends up in failure. Have you ever tried to diet using solely the power of will? It becomes a nightmare. Something similar can be said about recycling for example, because people are not going to do it if there is not a direct incentive for it.\n\nThat’s why a big aspect of Dukkha is deep and conscious creative work. It is one of the pillars of the whole thing. My thesis is that as soon as they discover that there is a means for expressing the particularities of all of who they are in the world through an original creation of their own, the willingness to spend time and energy in stuff that drains their life force will go down, and the willingness to give energy to activities that do the opposite will grow. But there needs to be an incentive in play, something for them to realize that there is something here. Something valuable and that can change their life.\n\nI wonder how this will play in reality. I’m sitting down in my computer alone in the early morning just throwing these words out here without a true and real understanding of the ghost of depression. There is a big motivation inside myself to move forward with this idea, but there is not a contrasting of it with reality. A validation. Not yet, because I still don’t have anything to show. For people to realize what I’m building. If I wanted to invite someone tomorrow to be part of this thing, I wouldn’t know how, because I don’t know how to explain it. That is something that I will start doing, building communication assets so that I can onboard people soon.\n\nI will create the first TJ that will start on November’s full moon, and it will be important to contrast everything that I have written about, and everything that I have inside, with the actual willingness for the people to participate in something that doesn’t exist yet That is a challenge, for sure. There will be a lot of trust needed, and I truly don’t have any trust because no one knows me yet. No one knows what I’m doing, not even me. So I need to bring it out of myself and into the common domain of things so t hat things can happen from there. It will be important.\n\nThat is one of the hallmarks of entrepreneurship probably: when you have an idea in the mind, you chew it over and over, and then when you throw it out into the world it becomes something completely different from what you expected. And all that time you spent chewing could have been used in a different way. So this is the moment on which I stop chewing, and decide to make this thing public so that people can start coming in. At least someone. There will be someone. I will reach out to the most depressed of all, and I’m sure that someone will come. And from there we will start.\n\nThe mission of Dukkha is to create online retreats, which are called Transformational Journeys, to transform depression into enlightment in the world.\n\nWe are built on top of a DAO model, so that the organization can be an autonomous one, on which all the participants will be able to make decisions on how to move forward with the building of tools that are helpful for our mission. Every TJ will be different than the previous one, and the goal for this organization is that each one of us decides what needs to be changed in order for that to happen.\n\nWe’ll keep iterating on what works, on what is more helpful for bringing people out of that hole.\n\nIf you consider yourself depressed and are willing to do what is necessary to take you out of there, this is the place to be. The first TJ will start the 9th of November, and in it we will work with the tools of Breathwork, Meditation and Deep Creative Work.\n\nThis is a very intense program, which is designed to truly be one of the most important experiences of your life. If it ends up not being such, we will ask you what can be fixed so that the next one will. With your input, every future person will benefit.\n\nWe are building the new world here, because each second that you are depressed, is a second on which your own, unique and special spark of light is buried inside the void. Humanity has lost too much because of that. It is time to evolve.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you haven’t used any of the tools that we’ll use. Here, you will discover that the most important thing of them all is just showing up. If you show up, a big chunk of the work is done, and what is left if moving towards an understanding of how to leave the mind aside, and act just from a place of being. That’s why all this tools are part of this program, because they are helpful for acting from a place of no-mind. For letting the depth of who you are arise from there.\n\nDepression is a condition that is associated with a very deep and strong identification with the ego, with that part of yourself that has been the means with which you have interacted with reality. In this retreat, we will build up conditions for a better understanding of the ego and how it works, so that you can realize that you are much more than what you think you are.\n\nThis program is not about the theory. We won’t give you material for studying. Everything is out there on the internet. It is about an experience of Doing The Work. Of sitting down, and facing your deepest fears so that you can realize that you are not them, and with that, grow a new understanding of who you are, and what you came here to do.\n\nYou will train yourself in the arts of consistency and presence, and we will all be supporting your journey. This is the most vulnerable place on which you will be, and each person that comes in will now this as a truth of being part of the circle. We will help each other get out of that hole. We will realize how amazing it is to be alive together. You will come back to life, with the help of your effort, and with the effort of everyone that has come before.\n\nThis is the Journey that you were waiting to the depths of who you are, to the truth, and I’m very glad that you are reading this words. If you want to know more about this whole thing, we can book a call and have a conversation. I’m completely here for you, the only thing that I want is to help.\n\n## Do you want to help yourself?\n\nAs I write those words there is a certain feeling that it will be hard to bring about people. I don’t have any traction whatsoever in the world. I don’t have any following, and there is no one that trusts me enough. It is going to be hard, and that is why defining who I’m going to speak to is such an important part of the whole thing.\n\nThe groups that come to me with more clarity are young people that are very depressed and deciding what to do with their life, or older ones that have gone through psychedelic assisted therapy and want to better know which is the way forward to go deeper with what they have experienced there. Or it also could be artists that want to deepen their practice, and connect strongly with the power of what being consistent and connected to their source is. There are so many options, and so many paths forward. It is confusing to me to realize which one to go, because I don’t have any particular connection with any of them.\n\nMaybe I need to take another look to the branding of the project, because the people with which I do have a connection are in another place. I feel connected to the avid meditators, the ones that want to experience the truth of their being. That is where I am at, and maybe I should be striving towards that direction. I don’t really know how to build this thing. I don’t really know how to connect the dots of my experience so that I can convey a message that is heard by people, and with that, helpful for this thing to work.\n\nIt seems that the one that I’m throwing out to the world right now is not helping too much, because I don’t happen to have too much traction on twitter. That is no good. But I have the opportunity to iterate, and with that, realize better who is the people that I’m going to point to for this first TJ. I’m no part of any community, but there is an intense suffering going on in the world which needs to be addressed. This project is all about that, is to help heal the suffering so that we can thrive as human beings. Who are the ones that are suffering? All the ones who are disconnected from their true nature, which is kind of most of humanity. How do I find a common ground within all that big group of people so that I can speak directly to them?\n\nThat is a work that I need to do. I need to start being part of communities that are actively working on the issues of depression, helping them and understanding what they are doing. Is there anything that is being done? I don’t think that there is too much happening that is really helpful, and the thing is that people are sent to those mental hospitals, given all those harmful drugs, and for what? To bury the pain inside. This project will be all about using tools for bringing that suffering to the surface, and processing it in community. That is a big aspect of this whole thing, the community. How we are going to organize with each other to get the most out of it. To truly learn how to Do The Work.\n\nThe thing is that I always speak from my point of view, from my capacities, and it is needed to bring in the one of the people which I will target, so that I can better understand them. That’s why it’s so important to have conversations with them, so I can pitch the idea, and get the feedback that I need to know how to make progress. I can spend my whole life working on the void just for myself, but it won’t work in a good way like that. I need to go out and do stuff with real people, have real conversations, and from there, learn about their pains, what they like doing, how they interact with each other, which is the source of their depression. Why are they where they are? Yes, but this is such a big planetary issue that it will be hard to find a particular aspect from which this comes. It is something that is present everywhere, and a big source of it is the expectation for things to be different. I expect to have more likes in social media, to have a different body, to have different friends, etc.\n\nEverything is an expectation that is built around a notion of time, around the perspective of a past that didn’t happen or a future that hopefully will come. Or a present that could be different. It is a circle that never ends. A void on which we are in and don’t know how to get out. Dukkha is doing its thing, and the only way in is through. It is by facing everything that is present and realizing that it is an illusion. Not by people telling these guys about it, but by them really embodying it by sitting down to Do The Work. It is crucial that they are able to Do The Work, so that they can make the progress that they need to advance.\n\nThe purpose of Dukkha is to end the suffering. And the only way out of the suffering is by the realization of their true nature. I’m building this and I ask myself: Do I really know how to do it? Nope, I don’t. But I’m building this whole networks. It is not about me, it is about everyone that will come. I want us to be free, and the important question as I go through this writing is: How to do it?\n\nThat is what all the masters have been trying to do throughout humanity. Writing books, creating teachings, everything to point towards the truth. Towards freedom. But this journey must be the simplest of them all, the journey within. Without dogmas, without religions, without anything particular. Just with an unknown person that will be the one directing the show. That is a big part of the whole thing, to have an unknown person that will be pushing it forward. I will just be another participant of it, because I need to go through something like this myself.\n\nAre you an avid practitioner of spirituality and want to go deeper into the understanding of what it is about? Have you dived deeper into everything that you have found to eventually realize that there is no way out of this thing? Have you tried everything that you have found to get out of the hole, just to realize that it gets deeper and deeper as you come back to identification with the aspects of your being that are not integrated and fully accepted? Are you done with the suffering?\n\nThis place is for you.\n\n--\n\nI have been dealing with the possibility of being a copywriter for a long time, but there isn’t clarity for me if I do it right or wrong. I feel a lot of resistance in the moment that I sit down and try to explain what I’m building here, it is hard to convey the message in a way that speaks clarity. That will make it hard to reach out to people, but how can I know if I haven’t done it? I have not had any conversation with anyone, and maybe it is time for me to just do it. Reach out. Open up the door for the understanding of what I’m doing, and be willing to receive feedback for it. I’m done with the suffering, and this is the moment on which I acknowledge it and write to the people that care about my ideas.\n\nI will set up the website as good as I can, and then reach out to people to get feedback about what is going to be done there. That is the way forward. Opening up my work and realizing that there will be someone willing to participate, at least giving their sincere opinion. The goal of this thing is to end the suffering, and I need to enjoy the process because what is at the other side is cool. I realize that all this time I have been writing from a place of ‘battling through’, with an energy that reminds me about something solid, dense, hard. That is not what I need to bring into the table.\n\nWhat I need is to tell a story, one of transformation, of realization, that people can relate to and from there tell what this whole thing is about. There is nothing more powerful than telling stories, we grew up with that, and it is what I have to be able to share to receive any particular feedback. How to tell a story? That is the main thing. I don’t know if I’m too good at it. Reach out. Feel free to explore. Feel free to know the truth. That is the thing. The character of the story really wants to know the truth. He is tired of running around in circles, jumping from one thing to the other. It is enough of it. This project will be around those notions, and I need to bring in part of them so that I can build the frame of reference more clearly. The important questions are:\n\nWhy?\nWho?\nWhen?\nWhat?\nHow?\n\nThose are the ones that I need to start asking myself. The answers will give me a direction on which to make progress with the understanding of who to talk to. How to direct this whole thing.\n\n--\n\nSomething deep is happening within me, something big is shifting. I can feel it, I can experience it every time that I sit down to meditate, every time that I gather my awareness into what is going on inside. I have gone from here to there running around in circles trying to understand what is it that I’m building in this moment, and in the meditation now it was clear that the most important thing for me going deeper is the meditation itself. I want to be there for people that want to further their path, I don’t feel very inclined to be with beginners. I already did that, with the yoga program that I created, and it is not what I want. I want to create a system for serious people, for those that are willing to put in the hours, to face their fears.\n\nWhat I’m building is the zendo for the metaverse. The place where we will gather to meditate. Nothing else matters than the practice. Just sit, and let it burn. That is the thing that I want to bring more of into the world, true practice of meditation. All the other things are just helpers for the practice, but nothing replaces sitting down. Just sit. That is the teaching that was most impactful for me at the retreat, and that is the one that I want to bring forth in the metaverse. This will be a place where people will gather to just sit. The meditation retreats will be held in here, and that is something that I still need to take into account: How does this whole model fit into what I have been thinking of the Transformational Journeys? What is up to those retreats?\n\nThere are still a lot of questions, but there is more clarity related to what the place will be for. The retreats may have practices and talks from experts from all over the world, that is something that the internet can leverage and it can be amazing in that sense. I can organize events and bring in experts to guide them. Dan spoke to me about the new generation of meditators, and this is the opportunity for me to speak to them. For me to open up the window for their practice, if they want to deepen their connection to spirit. For those who want to drink the most sweet nectar in the world. For those who want to experience the truth. In this place there won’t be levels of advancements, because each person will come and do his work on his own. There may be different teachers that help them related to where they are in their own practice, but at the end of the day what is important is that they come and sit.\n\nBut don’t forget the importance of the creative endeavor, and how connected the place will be to that. The whole zendo will be a piece of art, and people from all over the world will be the mecenas that will pay for it. That is what minting it as an NFT is about. I still need to better understand how the whole ecosystem works so that I can put up something appealing that makes sense, but the main idea is right in place. It is important for me to create these transformational journeys, and to create a place that will be the spiritual source of the metaverse. Where The Work will be Done. The name Dukkha definetly is making more noise now, because of everything that is has been shown from people that have commented on it. The one that came in during the meditation was “The Nest”, because around it I can create a story of people coming to build it, stick over stick. The other one that came is “The Womb”, with the phrase “Back to the source” beneath it.\n\nThere is an urge for this place to be connected to awakening. To filter out the noise. To create pointers for people to wake up. That is what the Transformational Journeys are about, to iterate over the concept of what is needed to create online for this experience to arise. Creating conditions of no escape for the ego, for people to feel contained on the experience, and for all of us to support that experience. Yes, Dukkha is not the best name, but it was a head start. It was the first iteration into exploring what it means to wake up the world in the metaverse. I’m understanding how to connect the dots here, and that is just by doing the work of finding out cool people to follow, which can lead me to where I need to go. Following 100s of people randomly in social media will not take me anywhere, because what I need to do is more specific. I need to be more intelligent in the quest of the relationships that I will foster, more intentional. Yes, that is the word that always comes: intention. I will be intentional with my connections, because they are going to be the ones that feed everything that I think about and do on the internet.\n\nMy connections need to be built around meditation. That is the most important thing. To sit and go deep. To help people in their process, and build up those experiences that will bring about what needs to be brought. Is 21 days too much? But it is the most important experience of your life. Would you miss it? Why don’t start with only 3 days? Why does it need to be 21? The thing is that the 21 day thing is for building a completely new way of existing on the individual. It is about bringing a reset on the way that they do things, so that they can start living life from the consequences of meditation. It is for them to create a life around the practice, around Doing The Work. It is about making The Work life, and making life The Work. And 21 days is an amount of time that is suitable for that. We are not robots, we are human beings, but if we are able to put everything in we can evolve easier. That is what this thing is about, designing that. Putting in the work that is needed to build the life that you want to live, so that you can balance everything and have time for what you want. Balance, everything is about balance, and these journeys are the ones that will bring that about. I will record my screen of the computer for the whole 21 day thing that starts on the 8th of November, because that is what will bring about the success that I want this thing to have. Yes, there will be periods of breaks inside the schedule of every day, but the important work will be done in the early stage of it. Push it through, put everything in, and let the results flow afterwards. That is the mission with all this thing, and the combination between the words sadhana, creativity, meditation, breathwork, presence, are the ones that are going to bring about what is needed for people to evolve.\n\nAlways remember to speak towards the early adopters. The ones that are willing to put everything in to get the results that they want, and from there start moving. The ones that believe in the thing. The ones that know that there is something being moved there.\n\nDiscipline and Doing The Work makes all the sense in the world for me, because it is about being efficient with your time. It is about giving everything that you’ve got to hunt, and then laying back so that you can enjoy as much as you can everything else. This is what I want to bring into the world, and that is why I’m doing what I’m doing. So I will go back to the 5 questions and start asking them with whatever comes in this moment:\n\nWHY?\n\nBasically to end the suffering. To provide means for people that want to be responsible for their life, to go through it. For people that want to Do The Work. That want to sit and practice in community. To connect with others that are serious about the thing. To go through it together. Because there is something big that is going to happen soon, and this project will foster that happening with the help of meditators from all over the world. Because people don’t truly know what meditation is about, and to establish educative means for that better understanding of this practice. Because it is what we need in the world of further development of technology, this is the means by which we go deeper into the understanding of ourselves. This is the most important journey that you can undertake in your life, the one within. It has always been like that, and it will always be. Technology is just a tool. To co-create the means for ending the suffering. For building them together, in community. There is no ideal one, but we will build it. The transformational journeys are what is needed for the evolution, to go a step deeper with intention, and in the commodity of your own house this can be something important. Or maybe even not in your own house, maybe we will eventually have places rented for this in different parts of the world, where people will connect and someone will take care of the whole thing for them. Why not rent a whole house and have people in charge of doing the retreat in there? And we just connect with those that are going through the TJ everywhere in the world. If you gather X amount of people and organize the thing, you can go through it together. Eventually this could also happen. This idea is very interesting, it could work for sure. Have people rent a house and create the conditions for the retreat there. Sounds like a very good idea, and the role of Dukkha would be to generate the connection between the people in the same place and also broadcast the retreat with people from all over the world. But the thing with this is that it is still ‘away from normal life’. The whole idea of Dukkha is to create a new way of living life. Bringing people into a new understanding of what is possible if they arrange their life in a new way. And this means doing the extraordinary, but within the ordinary. Go within, within your life. Don’t escape your life, make the sadhana part of it. That is the goal of this thing. That is the why. To help people live in an extraordinary way in the ordinary.\n\nBecause there is a deep need of disconnection, of something that is not usual, something different from daily life, and this will be the means for that to happen. Creating a new daily life. The big reset. The big new way of doing things. That is what it is about. Creating a new way. Resetting the way on which we have been experiencing life so that we can be in harmony with what is better for ourselves. We are creative forces, and we need to develop systems so that we can unleash that. This is the way of creating those systems in daily life, so that they can be used for as much people as possible, everywhere in the world.\n\n\n\nWHO?\n\nThose who are serious in their stuff. Who want to evolve. The ones that know that there is something more out there, and want to connect to it consistently. The ones that want to be an active part in modern society, in the building of the world. The ones that are willing to take risks, and throw themselves into the unknown. Yes, probably the people that have done psychedelics often, because they are the ones that know. They are the ones that have the experience.\n\nThe ones that want to experience the truth. The ones that are tired with the way on which things have been done until now. The ones that are sick of the way on which things are working. The ones that don’t want to polarize anymore, that just want to find unity in all things. The ones that want to explore every corner of what it means to be a human being. The ones that are depressed, and don’t see a way out. The ones that are willing to kill themselves to find that way out. For them is this project. It is a new way of thinking about a way out.\n\nIt is in honor of every master that has ever lived, for their message, for what they brought into humanity. It is a translation of their message into the words of the present. Of this present. It is a remembering of what they came to tell us, and that has been forgotten. It is an acknowledgment of their path, of all the steps that they walked.\n\nFor everyone that cares about planet earth, and all of what this place has given us. For those who want to be an active part in the creation of this new earth, more conscious, more connected to everything that is.\n\nFor the visionaries of the future.\n\nFor the eternal seekers. For those who are thirsty of knowing.\n\nFor those that are deep into Dukkha, because it is never enough.\n\n\n\nWHEN?\n\nEvery month, during 21 days, starting from the day of the full moon. That will be the beginning of each TJ, and the first journey will be in November 2022.\n\nAlso every day there will be meditations held in the zendo, which will be open in the metaverse. There is still an understanding that needs to take place in order to get which metaverse is it going to be the one on which this will start, which is going to be the zendo, but that is work in progress. There is a lot of study to be made. There will be time for that.\n\nIt is already happening. You are already waking up, you just need the pointers to realize that there is nothing to look for in the outside. All the information that you need is within you. Dukkha will be about developing the means to learn how to not search for that information, and just let it spring from the infinite source of life.\n\nIt happens every day, as I sit down and do the work. As I try to connect more with those that are serious, that want to go deeper.\n\n\n\nWHAT?\n\nA community of practice. Of Doing The Work. Transformational Journeys that will be iterated over and over and that will be the means by which we will understand who you are. What is the truth of your being.\n\nPractice.\n\nNot more theory, not more reading, not more mind. This is the place of no mind. Goodbye mind, you have been a good master, thank you, but it is time for something different to get into the drivers seat.\n\nCreating conditions of no escape for the ego. That is what is going to happen here. For people to show up and Do The Work. The rest will happen from there.\n\n\n\nHOW?\n\nBy connecting with people on twitter and establishing a network of those who are serious about the thing.\n\nBy buying a piece of land in the metaverse(s) and beginning to build in there the Zendo. How can it be built in different metaverses at the same time? Should it be one and only?\n\nBy showing up to hold space. That will add up eventually. Showing up and holding space for the transformation of others… That is what is needed for this thing to work. Eventually it will catch up, but with my passion, discipline and caring it will do. I only need to show up and eventually it will start working. I have everything on my side. I just need to refine the message with which I’m approaching the world.\n\nBy grabbing the light and putting it towards the work of others. Towards what they are. Every one of us is a spark of light, each and every one of us, and this place will be a celebration of that. It will be a worshipping of god by worshipping the god that we all have inside. Celebrating that, acknowledging it, and embracing it.\n",

Why are they where they are? Yes, but this is such a big planetary issue that it will be hard to find a particular aspect from which this comes.

It is by facing everything that is present and realizing that it is an illusion. Not by people telling these guys about it, but by them really embodying it by sitting down to Do The Work.

I want to be there for people that want to further their path, I don\\u2019t feel very inclined to be with beginners.

For me to open up the window for their practice, if they want to deepen their connection to spirit. For those who want to drink the most sweet nectar in the world. For those who want to experience the truth. In this place there won\\u2019t be levels of advancements, because each person will come and do his work on his own.

I still need to better understand how the whole ecosystem works so that I can put up something appealing that makes sense, but the main idea is right in place. It is important for me to create these transformational journeys, and to create a place that will be the spiritual source of the metaverse. Where The Work will be Done. The name Dukkha definetly is making more noise now, because of everything that is has been shown from people that have commented on it. The one that came in during the meditation was \\u201CThe Nest\\u201D, because around it I can create a story of people coming to build it, stick over stick.

To filter out the noise. To create pointers for people to wake up. That is what the Transformational Journeys are about, to iterate over the concept of what is needed to create online for this experience to arise. Creating conditions of no escape for the ego, for people to feel contained on the experience, and for all of us to support that experience. Yes, Dukkha is not the best name, but it was a head start. It was the first iteration into exploring what it means to wake up the world in the metaverse. I\\u2019m understanding how to connect the dots here, and that is just by doing the work of finding out cool people to follow, which can lead me to where I need to go. Following 100s of people randomly in social media will not take me anywhere, because what I need to do is more specific. I need to be more intelligent in the quest of the relationships that I will foster, more intentional. Yes, that is the word that always comes: intention. I will be intentional with my connections, because they are going to be the ones that feed everything that I think about and do on the internet.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"My connections need to be built around meditation. That is the most important thing. To sit and go deep. To help people in their process, and build up those experiences that will bring about what needs to be brought. Is 21 days too much? But it is the most important experience of your life. Would you miss it? Why don\\u2019t start with only 3 days? Why does it need to be 21? The thing is that the 21 day thing is for building a completely new way of existing on the individual. It is about bringing a reset on the way that they do things, so that they can start living life from the consequences of meditation. It is for them to create a life around the practice, around Doing The Work. It is about making The Work life, and making life The Work. And 21 days is an amount of time that is suitable for that. We are not robots, we are human beings, but if we are able to put everything in we can evolve easier. That is what this thing is about, designing that. Putting in the work that is needed to build the life that you want to live, so that you can balance everything and have time for what you want. Balance, everything is about balance, and these journeys are the ones that will bring that about. I will record my screen of the computer for the whole 21 day thing that starts on the 8th of November, because that is what will bring about the success that I want this thing to have. Yes, there will be periods of breaks inside the schedule of every day, but the important work will be done in the early stage of it. Push it through, put everything in, and let the results flow afterwards.

To provide means for people that want to be responsible for their life, to go through it. For people that want to Do The Work. That want to sit and practice in community. To connect with others that are serious about the thing. To go through it together. Because there is something big that is going to happen soon, and this project will foster that happening with the help of meditators from all over the world. Because people don\\u2019t truly know what meditation is about, and to establish educative means for that better understanding of this practice. Because it is what we need in the world of further development of technology, this is the means by which we go deeper into the understanding of ourselves. This is the most important journey that you can undertake in your life, the one within. It has always been like that, and it will always be. Technology is just a tool. To co-create the means for ending the suffering. For building them together, in community. There is no ideal one, but we will build it. The transformational journeys are what is needed for the evolution, to go a step deeper with intention, and in the commodity of your own house this can be something important. Or maybe even not in your own house, maybe we will eventually have places rented for this in different parts of the world, where people will connect and someone will take care of the whole thing for them. Why not rent a whole house and have people in charge of doing the retreat in there? And we just connect with those that are going through the TJ everywhere in the world. If you gather X amount of people and organize the thing, you can go through it together. Eventually this could also happen. This idea is very interesting, it could work for sure. Have people rent a house and create the conditions for the retreat there. Sounds like a very good idea, and the role of Dukkha would be to generate the connection between the people in the same place and also broadcast the retreat with people from all over the world. But the thing with this is that it is still \\u2018away from normal life\\u2019. The whole idea of Dukkha is to create a new way of living life. Bringing people into a new understanding of what is possible if they arrange their life in a new way. And this means doing the extraordinary, but within the ordinary. Go within, within your life. Don\\u2019t escape your life, make the sadhana part of it. That is the goal of this thing. That is the why.

Resetting the way on which we have been experiencing life so that we can be in harmony with what is better for ourselves.

    "raw": "\nThis is one of those days on which I could have skipped coming and I could have called it a day because it has been amazing until now (in spite of a new argument with my partner that happened right before coming here) but then after the argument I realized that the best thing I could do right now was to come here to bring out all the stuff that I can from the inside so that I can clean myself a little bit. This book is about giving myself the opportunity to integrate my life by bringing out all the aspects of it that have not been spoken, all of them that are there around making noise, and I have not been able to talk to anyone. Right after the first part of our argument I went to walk outside and started thinking that the amount of emotional work that I have done this last years is nuts. I really hope that there is a place somewhere where someone is watching, because I have done it all on my own, without anyone there to tell me that I’m doing it good. I haven’t had any figure outside myself that has told me: ‘congratulations, you are doing it good’. I mean, my brother tells me that, but he definetly not knows everything that I have gone through. It has been incredible. And being next to this woman is like bringing that emotional work to the limit, because I truly think that what I have had to go through next to her is not normal. I mean, what is normal, anyway? It doesn’t make too much sense to say this, because every person in the world can say it. There is no point of comparison. But I can speak for my own experience, and tell you, dear reader, that I’m fucking exhausted. I don’t know if it is because of the process of awakening, or what, but my brain is going to explode. The good thing related to having written all this book is that if it ever happens I will have a testament for you to read about what was going on inside me in these times. The times when I died. Those times when my brain exploded. So it makes sense to speak here about my story, and about what brings me to say all this what I’m saying. I haven’t been able to tell this story to anyone, there doesn’t seem to be anyone truly interested, or with enough time, or whatever. It is just something that I need to take out and I can’t in other means so I will do my best to do it here.\n\nI don’t even know where to start. I guess that what makes sense is to tell the story about Ivan, the guy where I worked in Croatia. I stayed in his proyect working for workaway, one thing where you worked on the place where you were staying and they gave you a place where to stay. This guy was very different from normal people in the streets, and on my second day there we had a very tense relationship I don’t even remember why (I know that he had a big problem in one of his teeth and that was bringing a lot of physical pain which he was throwing around to all of us, but there was a lot of that directed to me). So he asked me for help with the structure that held a grape tree and I remember that he was speaking to me and as he was speaking I was listening with as much attention as I could but not taking notes so then we went to the forest and he gave me a hand axe and he told me to take wood from there to fix the thing and left me there angry because I did not take notes and I did not know what I needed.\n\nBut I trusted a lot my intuition, and that’s why I hadn’t taken notes. So he went away angry and left me there and I remember thinking that he was going to come back and kill me and no one would know about me anymore so I was there thinking that he was coming back and I found a tree that was perfect to fix what I had to fix, like more perfect that anything that he would have imagined that was possible. With one tree I fixed what he thought needed like 4 different beams, so that was the specific moment on which I gained his respect. I remember when I went away he was very emotional, almost up to tears. And a few days before I went there a woman came and she was amazing and she told me that she had dreamt with that place and then she took me with some friend for camping next to a river and on the river there was a friend of her that was identical to Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings and he was there with like two tents and they were his house and he lived there and people came down through the river rafting and there was Gandalf doing his thing. I remember that he had a disco ball on a tree that was just there where people went by through the river. It was crazy. What an incredible character. So he was friends with this woman but they only spoke Croatian so then my friend told me that he was not too happy to have me (a stranger) there in his house so we had to go away and we were away and she started telling me the story of her life. She told me that when she was at a young age with her mother she asked her mother:\n\n- Why did you try to abort me when you were pregnant?\n\nAnd her mother could not believe her words and how she could remember that and this woman had like incredible superpowers and because of that she was very isolated from society and they had sent her to the psychiatry Clinique a lot of times and I remember she telling me that they used to drug her to make her unconscious and there were 3 months of her life that she did not remember and then she told me that when she started telling stuff to the people that worked there they treated her like a piece of shit, even to the point of putting poop in her mouth. She was crying a lot when she was telling me these stories and it was fucking crazy to be listening to her and thinking how I could have ended up having a day like that. Being with Gandalf and then with a woman that had been as wounded as her. Crazy shit. And then we stayed in the tent with some friend of hers and at the other day I remember that I woke up earlier than all of them and I got a pen and cut a piece of wood and wrote something in the piece of wood and left it there as a present for her and got all my stuff and went away walking to the nearest village on which I took a bus to go back to the place where this person that I thought wanted to kill me because I did not know how to hold the vine together. And then the next day I left that place, and went to stay with another friend that I had met outside of a music store of a guy named Leo, in Stari Grad. The place where my great-great-grandfather lives before coming to Chile. So I went to Stari Grad and ended up becoming friends with this guy Leo and the next day this other guy Vice came and we also became friends and I remember that I had a huge beard and then we said ‘see you on the ferry’ and I shaved and then I met Vice and his gf on the ferry and they were crazy laughing because I did not have beard anymore and I have changed so much.\n\nAnd Vice took me to his father’s house and he was the person that I have seen that has the worse Diogenes disease, his house was full of shit. You can’t even imagine how much shit he had in there. So yes, there he was, and he made one of the best fish that I have eaten in my whole life. His house was absolutely dirty, but he was an amazing chef. And an amazing alcohol creator also because he gave me as a present a thing called grapa which he had done with hazelnuts and I brough that one with me to india and spent 3 weeks there before finding a group of friends with which to drink it and it was great to be with them. But that is part of another story. So yes, I was talking about this guy that wanted to kill me, and how much I learned in that place about the way on which I work. I’m not useful to come up with the preconceived ideas.\n\nI d0n’t work like that. I need to think out of the box. It is not something that I do, it is something that I need. It is an aspect of myself that is expressed in every interaction that I have in life, and this two years it has been crazy because I have been challenging this creativity only with myself. I have been coming here to Do The Work on my own, without anyone telling me if I’m doing it good or bad. I just do it, and I am my own critic. And it is very exhausting. I’m tired of it, because I’m a very bad critic. As you could have guessed by reading this book, it is never enough. It is hard for me to think about something that is enough, it is hard for me to give me time to rest, to not be doing stuff, so it is easy to burn and burn and burn me. And who knows if this thing that is going on inside my brain is because of the awakening process or because the burn out. Definetly I’m burned out in my house. I’m tired to be there pushing so hard with this thing and not finding that balance. I know that it is me the one that needs to stay quiet, but I find it very, very, very hard to do it. There seems to be an impossibility inside to stay quiet. And that doesn’t help me. Because sometimes I am in an argument and it comes to me that the best that I could do in that moment is to shut down and let her win, but it is fucking hard. I haven’t been able to do it yet. But I need it. I don’t think that I will last too much more without it.\n\nOr maybe it is the process of awakening, because the thing that I feel is as if I had a knot of energy that is absolutely focused on the area of the third eye. When I lie on my back, it gets very, very intense, and when I am sitting in the lotus position, especially at night, also. I wonder if it is related to the development of the third eye. There is a big part of myself that trusts, and that knows that it is that, but there is also another part that likes being big that tells me that everything is OK, and that I’m doing it right. And that is the thing, I need to be able to transform everything that I have done, everything that I am, into an act of creation so that I can become free from all the boundaries that I have built for myself. And I guess that this thing in the third eye is related to that, it is energy wanting to move through a system that is ready for it, that has already worked with it, and it is time to tell you that I have been for a long time writing without seeing, so I don’t know what I have said in these last minutes. It is just a freeeflow of consciousness, an exploration into what comes at the other side of knowing that. Thjat is the thing. It is too good. What came to mind ere the words: ‘Your vagina is too good to be public’, and I was recalling a conversation with my partner. See, the unconscious is wicked. It is. Time for all of us to acknowledge, and let it shine through our actions. Integrating one of them as the means of exploring more and more the depths of the human psyche. That is what this whole thing is about: What comes at the other side of a person wanting to live so much tht he ended up with his life. That is what happened with David Foster Wallace, the biggest idol that I have in my life. It is crazy that the biggest idol that I have ended p commiting suicide, and I wonder which is the explanation of that. If there is even an exploration. If there is a willingness to rest. To prepare. This is the time on which we are able to build on top of the wealth that our grandparents have planted for us.\n\nToday is the day on which we acknowledge that 170 years have gone by since the colonization in the place where I live from the germans. My family comes from this story, and today is the day on which I remember all my ancestors formally and express my gratitude to them. I went to a ceremony with my parents and a lot of old people were there, and very few young ones. It is incredible to see that there are a few young ones. How would the world look like if we gave ourselves more permission to be grateful to our ancestors? You are here reading this because of everyone that came before you, and it is time to honor that and build the present from that understanding. Afterwards I went to see my grandmother and told her that I was grateful for her life, that I admired her, and she did not want to accept my words. But I know she received them somewhere, and it doesn’t truly matter because everything that I do is in memory of them. Today I asked my mother: How do you think is a good way of honoring the ancestors? She said: ‘Being grateful’.\n\nI want to go a bit further from that and tell you that my answer would be: Be gratitude. And how can you embody gratitude? By working hard on being the best version of yourself. Whatever that may look like. But do an effort to consciously be the best version of yourself. And that best is an always evolving exploration, it is a tool, because it is the landmark over which you can build up a better understanding of where you are and where you are going. And that is everything that you need, because the most that you can do is to live in the present moment. When you are there, the future doesn’t exist, everything unfolds as a consequence of what you are bringing into the world. Right here, right now. So there won’t be histories that could be, or other ones that should be. Or shouldn’t. Nope, remember that we are trying to get rid of that word here. By living in the present you become free from the consequences of needing something to be like this or that. You become free from what should be, you just are. And that is all that matters. That is the thing, that is the game. It is the most efficient way to live because no part of your life force will be directed towards the mental processes that like to build a reality that is not there, by imagining something that is in the future, or building up stories about the past. Nope. Everything that is going on is a consequence of what is happening right here, right now, and by bringing your awareness more and more to this fact you will become more and more free. From the burden of having to be someone specific. From the burden of having to be someone different than yourself. That is the game we are playing here, and that is the present that you can give yourself if you navigate this path long enough.\n\nBut I don’t know, maybe I’m just talking nonsense because my brain is fried because of all the meditation. I don’t know if I’m failing or evolving. There are sensations for either inside. Sometimes I truly think that my brain is going to explode, and other times I have sensations going on that make me feel that the limitations that are inside my system related to the relationship that my whole being has with the universe are being dissolved. And that dissolution brings about the absolute freedom of being, because it is a consequence of a cease in the identification with the egoic mind. And the egoic mind is the one that is building all this reality, the one that feels that it needs to become awakened. That is what this whole book is about, about my mind trying to wake up. This is what happens when there is a human being that has everything in life, and enough time to pursuit a goal like this one. I end up becoming a psychopath, crazy in the journey of becoming something different from what I am but realizing that I already am everything that I will ever be and the only thing that I need to do is take away everything that I’m not. But it is fucking hard, you know. It is way easier than said, I can speak for that for sure. I have lived it. Until now I have survived, but I truly can’t tell you about the future. I’m not worried about what will happen to my young and amazing daughter, because she will be OK. She will have fun, and all the aspects of hereself that she could miss because of not having a father will end up coming on one way or another one. It is just about time. It is crazy to witness myself writing as if I was going to die. It is not that I want to kill myself, by any means. There is an aspect of me that knows that the only way on which I will evolve is by learning how to die before I die, but it is hard to realize how that will happen. I always tell myself that I have something specific to do so that I can help that process happen, but when I do that I’m forcing something that doesn’t want to happen yet, and maybe that is why I have this knot in the brain. In the middle of it, on the area between the eyebrows to the back. That is why I’m talking about my own death, because maybe it will explode and it will create a big damage inside. I don’t know. Maybe that will happen, and I just want you to know that all this pushing through that I have done is just for bringing more and more consciousness to the world. I know that the evolution of humanity is a process that will happen when we all wake up to our true nature, and what I have been doing desperately is trying to wake up to my true nature. I may be very extreme at times, but please forgive me if I died because I truly did my best. Shit happens sometimes. But I did my best. I know that my girl with be in good hands. I ask you that please. If you can ever invite her and tell her what you felt reading this book it would be crazy. Amazing. She would know that her father was in pursuit of truth. That he died for the truth to come forth. That is my one and only mission right now truly. I know that I should be experimenting life, and enjoying outside and everything but I truly can’t if I know that there is a way of experiencing reality that I’m not living through right now. The sole fact that there is a way of interfacing with all that is that is from a level of integration and from the ceasing of duality fills my whole being with curiosity, and I just can’t stop walking this path. I’m doing my best in it, being as self aware as I can be with the stuff I do. I’m being mindful with my food, with my practices, with everything, but who knows, maybe I just fucked it.\n\nBut I want you to know that I had a blast. This has been a life well lived. I could be telling you stories about stuff that has happened in my life for a long long time, but they doesn’t seem to flow as this kind of writing. There is a kind of stuck-ness when I write a story.\n\nLet’s see, I’ll try again.\n\nThe one that comes right now is in a transformational festival that I went in hungary, called ozora. In it, there was a psychedelic art gallery, and a guy called oliver Vernon that was painting an amazing painting throughout the whole festival in a stage that I will call the heaven in spite of a better naming and because I don’t remember which was its name. But it was like a heaven for me. The whole thematic of the festival was the labyrinth, and there was a map that painted the labyrinth in it and one day I took a lot of LSD and headed on a mission to explore the maze that was in the map and I got to that place and the thing that was in there was a huge cornfield. Huge. And I realized that it was kind of a metaphor for the labyrinth so I had the feeling that I understood it and didn’t enter and decided to go to the heaven instead so I went to the heaven and it was very hard for me to walk there because I had to walk through something that felt like the worst sand on which my feet were getting stuck and it felt like an eternity to get there and now that I write it I recall Dante’s Divine Comedy and it resembles it because it was very hard to walk like going through hell but then I arrived to the heaven and a woman came to the small stage with the violin and started playing some of the most amazing music that my eyes had heard before. And I remember being flying through the cosmos as I was listening to her music and afterwards I gave her a very strong hug and thanked her and what I remember the most was her smell. She had a very strong alcoholic smell, on her whole body. I don’t know if it was true or what, but it is part of how I experienced that moment. And then I became weird and I could not continue talking with her because I had taken a lot of LSD and there is stayed the conversation but that is one of the memories that I store the most in my heart about the serendipity of life and how the most memorable moments are built over random stuff. That adventure makes me happy.\n\nAnd writing about the smell of alcohol of her brings me to think about my own problems with alcohol, which is a substance that I drank a loooooot in a big part of my life. I used to drink every weekend, since Friday to Sunday, and a lot. It was crazy. And a big part of me thinks right now: which is the relationship that my incredible amount of intake of alcohol has with the incredible capacity that I have for being extreme in what I do? For this deep and infinite seeking of the truth? There is noise in me related to the fact that alcohol in English is called spirit, and how much I liked being drunk because of how I could better navigate the world without that voice inside my head that was not telling me what I should not do. I could just go and talk to that girl. I felt that I just could be more of myself. And that felt good. Not having that voice inside. So I definetly abused of it, and I’m sure it created a long term harm in my whole system. Maybe this tense ball that I have in my brain is a consequence of all the alcohol that I drank, that is something that I think about a lot. Another thing that comes to mind is all the times on which I have told my parents not to eat sugar, or to eat healthier, or whatever, and then I go back to all those years on which I drank like that and now I think: Obviously I took more years of my life then than what my parents have done because of their ‘bad eating habits’. And I never listened to them when they told me not to drink that much. I never could listen, I was too deep into the thing. And my parents never told me that I should listen more. But now that I think about it, they would have made me a huge favor if they had sent me to a place where they could help me. I really had a problem. And I don’t know which is the fix. Now I don’t consider myself alcoholic. Sometimes I drink, but it is not something that I cannot control. But I like drinking. It is one of the most important substances of my life, definetly. I haven’t been drinking for some weeks now, but I remember always that sensation that you have when you drink the first sip. It is felt, right away. There is something that shifts inside, and that was what I always loved about it. And it was never enough.\n\nIn my life, almost anything is ever enough. That is something that defines my relationship with doing stuff. It is never enough. Whatever I may do, I go all in with in, and in that, I go deeper and deeper into the exploration of which are the consequences of bringing that into my life. Holy shit, it is never enough. And one of the most important pieces of timeless wisdom is the need for balance. For finding that sweet spot on which you are not acting in the seeking of pure pleasure, or lust, or whatever. Balance is the key. And no matter what, I’m not able to find that sweet spot. I’m working on that, I can tell you. But it is incredibly hard.\n\nAnyway, it is crazy all the journey that I have travelled since I started this writing session. I don’t even remember which was my mission when I started, but now it comes clearly that it was to be grateful. For my ancestors, and for the journey that I have taken until this point. I told you, I have many, many stories in my body, but it is hard for me to bring them forth. What is easier is to share with you who I am because of them. Which is my truth after having lived those stories fully. And that is the truth of who I am, the consequences of everything that I have gone through. And I can’t tell you specifically which are the stories that determine this or that, because there are infinite of them, but I can just tell you that in this moment, right here, right now, I’m working hard on becoming more and more of myself. And it has been fucking brutal. I would love to have someone to tell me: ‘well done brother, I see your effort’, but there is no one. Not even my partner, that lives with me. She doesn’t understand anything. And it is ok. It is not for he to understand. I’m not doing this for her. That is the base line of this whole game. Everything I do, at the end of the day, is just for myself. And for my little girl that right now is my responsibility, but more than that I’m selfish and I think of myself. Because I know that if I evolve as a human being the consequences will ripple to her, so that’s why I keep showing up and Doing The Work, day after day, without anyone in the world letting me know if I’m doing it in a good or bad way. That polarization doesn’t help anyone, the important thing is that I am, just doing it. The important thing is to do it. I thought about not coming and watching a film with my partner, but I’m happy I didn’t because what came here is important. And bringing out what I have inside is more important than anything that I can do right now, because it is the means by which I better understand myself. This is a gift that I’m giving me, it is an invitation to explore more and more of who I am, and in that exploration is all the value of the world. The value that I give to myself. No one will ever know what I’ve gone through, but it doesn’t matter. Because I know. And that is all that matters.\n\nWhat came now is the story of the 21st of September of 2020, when I after the birthday celebration of my father I went to the forest (where I had pitched my tent) and took a lot of LSD, on my own. I had a mirror, a flashlight, and water. And my sleeping bag. And a picture of me and my partner. So I was just there, tripping my balls off and going through the nightmare of what it felt to be hidden in that tent in the middle of nowhere, without anyone knowing that I was there. I hadn’t told anyone. And I remember watching me at the eyes through the mirror and seeing my whole face change, but the only thing that was constant, the only thing that remained were my eyes. My face could be that of an old person, of a baby, whatever, but the eyes were the same. And that taught me a lot about what it means to be alive. Awareness is always watching. It is always present. I have been here since the dawn of time, and if it is hard for me to see it right now is because I’m identified with the character that I’m playing right now. But that is not eternal. It is not an eternal part of the game. I will end up realizing that I’m much more than this, and I will become free. I don’t know if it will be in this lifetime, writing this book, or meditating, or whatever. It doesn’t really matter. If my brain explodes next week it doesn’t matter, because there will be another opportunity. Life continues its path, with me or without, and that is the cosmic joke. That I can identify myself as the savior, as the helper of the world, and my life can end tomorrow and nothing of that could happen. But maybe I died and you are reading this and it is amazing because all this time that I wrote it I thought that no one would ever read it.\n\nWho knows. It’s crazy. So many artitsts that dies without knowing that their craft would end up being important for thousands of people. It is just part of life. That’s why the important part of it is not doing it for them. It is doing it for me. I come here to write, for me. To bring out what is becoming toxic inside here. To process what is in here. To transform it into something different, to channel all my creative energy into something new that is brought into the world. To focus all my being into the act of creation so that I can move each day a step forward towards the integration and dissolution of my being into it. TO become it. Each day that I come and sit down and Do The Work is a day on which I become a little bit more of who I truly am. Just by being here, witnessing what came up, I’m making at least a small step towards that. And in this moment of my life, that is all that matters. That is the magic of this thing. That is the present that I give me. Yes, this is a present that I’m giving me.\n\nMore than once today I have told through my writing that no one will ever know what I have gone through. No one will ever realize all the emotional work that I have done in the last years. And it doesn’t matter. Because I’m doing it for me. I am the one that has been listening, I am the one that has been witnessing, I am the one that has stretched those hands, I am the one that has stared into those eyes, I am the one that has met that people, I am the one that knows. And that is all that matters. That is the beauty of this whole thing, that it truly doesn’t matter because the only one that needs to know is me. And the more free I become to try to explain, or bring other people in, or transform them in any way, I evolve more and more.\n\nAnd that’s what I came here for. To have this experience. To evolve.\n\nThank you again for reading. Thank you for being.\n",

This book is about giving myself the opportunity to integrate my life by bringing out all the aspects of it that have not been spoken, all of them that are there around making noise, and I have not been able to talk to anyone. Right after the first part of our argument I went to walk outside and started thinking that the amount of emotional work that I have done this last years is nuts.

Those times when my brain exploded. So it makes sense to speak here about my story, and about what brings me to say all this what I\\u2019m saying.

This guy was very different from normal people in the streets, and on my second day there we had a very tense relationship I don\\u2019t even remember why (I know that he had a big problem in one of his teeth and that was bringing a lot of physical pain which he was throwing around to all of us, but there was a lot of that directed to me). So he asked me for help with the structure that held a grape tree and I remember that he was speaking to me and as he was speaking I was listening with as much attention as I could but not taking notes so then we went to the forest and he gave me a hand axe and he told me to take wood from there to fix the thing and left me there angry because I did not take notes and I did not know what I needed.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"But I trusted a lot my intuition, and that\\u2019s why I hadn\\u2019t taken notes. So he went away angry and left me there and I remember thinking that he was going to come back and kill me and no one would know about me anymore so I was there thinking that he was coming back and I found a tree that was perfect to fix what I had to fix, like more perfect that anything that he would have imagined that was possible. With one tree I fixed what he thought needed like 4 different beams, so that was the specific moment on which I gained his respect. I remember when I went away he was very emotional, almost up to tears. And a few days before I went there a woman came and she was amazing and she told me that she had dreamt with that place and then she took me with some friend for camping next to a river and on the river there was a friend of her that was identical to Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings and he was there with like two tents and they were his house and he lived there and people came down through the river rafting and there was Gandalf doing his thing. I remember that he had a disco ball on a tree that was just there where people went by through the river. It was crazy. What an incredible character. So he was friends with this woman but they only spoke Croatian so then my friend told me that he was not too happy to have me (a stranger) there in his house so we had to go away and we were away and she started telling me the story of her life. She told me that when she was at a young age with her mother she asked her mother:\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.ul,{children:[`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.li,{children:\"Why did you try to abort me when you were pregnant?\"}),`\n`]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And her mother could not believe her words and how she could remember that and this woman had like incredible superpowers and because of that she was very isolated from society and they had sent her to the psychiatry Clinique a lot of times and I remember she telling me that they used to drug her to make her unconscious and there were 3 months of her life that she did not remember and then she told me that when she started telling stuff to the people that worked there they treated her like a piece of shit, even to the point of putting poop in her mouth. She was crying a lot when she was telling me these stories and it was fucking crazy to be listening to her and thinking how I could have ended up having a day like that. Being with Gandalf and then with a woman that had been as wounded as her. Crazy shit. And then we stayed in the tent with some friend of hers and at the other day I remember that I woke up earlier than all of them and I got a pen and cut a piece of wood and wrote something in the piece of wood and left it there as a present for her and got all my stuff and went away walking to the nearest village on which I took a bus to go back to the place where this person that I thought wanted to kill me because I did not know how to hold the vine together. And then the next day I left that place, and went to stay with another friend that I had met outside of a music store of a guy named Leo, in Stari Grad. The place where my great-great-grandfather lives before coming to Chile. So I went to Stari Grad and ended up becoming friends with this guy Leo and the next day this other guy Vice came and we also became friends and I remember that I had a huge beard and then we said \\u2018see you on the ferry\\u2019 and I shaved and then I met Vice and his gf on the ferry and they were crazy laughing because I did not have beard anymore and I have changed so much.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And Vice took me to his father\\u2019s house and he was the person that I have seen that has the worse Diogenes disease, his house was full of shit.

His house was absolutely dirty, but he was an amazing chef. And an amazing alcohol creator also because he gave me as a present a thing called grapa which he had done with hazelnuts and I brough that one with me to india and spent 3 weeks there before finding a group of friends with which to drink it and it was great to be with them. But that is part of another story. So yes, I was talking about this guy that wanted to kill me, and how much I learned in that place about the way on which I work.

It is not something that I do, it is something that I need. It is an aspect of myself that is expressed in every interaction that I have in life, and this two years it has been crazy because I have been challenging this creativity only with myself. I have been coming here to Do The Work on my own, without anyone telling me if I\\u2019m doing it good or bad. I just do it, and I am my own critic. And it is very exhausting. I\\u2019m tired of it, because I\\u2019m a very bad critic. As you could have guessed by reading this book, it is never enough. It is hard for me to think about something that is enough, it is hard for me to give me time to rest, to not be doing stuff, so it is easy to burn and burn and burn me. And who knows if this thing that is going on inside my brain is because of the awakening process or because the burn out. Definetly I\\u2019m burned out in my house. I\\u2019m tired to be there pushing so hard with this thing and not finding that balance. I know that it is me the one that needs to stay quiet, but I find it very, very, very hard to do it. There seems to be an impossibility inside to stay quiet. And that doesn\\u2019t help me. Because sometimes I am in an argument and it comes to me that the best that I could do in that moment is to shut down and let her win, but it is fucking hard. I haven\\u2019t been able to do it yet. But I need it. I don\\u2019t think that I will last too much more without it.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Or maybe it is the process of awakening, because the thing that I feel is as if I had a knot of energy that is absolutely focused on the area of the third eye. When I lie on my back, it gets very, very intense, and when I am sitting in the lotus position, especially at night, also. I wonder if it is related to the development of the third eye. There is a big part of myself that trusts, and that knows that it is that, but there is also another part that likes being big that tells me that everything is OK, and that I\\u2019m doing it right. And that is the thing, I need to be able to transform everything that I have done, everything that I am, into an act of creation so that I can become free from all the boundaries that I have built for myself. And I guess that this thing in the third eye is related to that, it is energy wanting to move through a system that is ready for it, that has already worked with it, and it is time to tell you that I have been for a long time writing without seeing, so I don\\u2019t know what I have said in these last minutes. It is just a freeeflow of consciousness, an exploration into what comes at the other side of knowing that. Thjat is the thing. It is too good. What came to mind ere the words: \\u2018Your vagina is too good to be public\\u2019, and I was recalling a conversation with my partner. See, the unconscious is wicked. It is. Time for all of us to acknowledge, and let it shine through our actions. Integrating one of them as the means of exploring more and more the depths of the human psyche. That is what this whole thing is about: What comes at the other side of a person wanting to live so much tht he ended up with his life. That is what happened with David Foster Wallace, the biggest idol that I have in my life. It is crazy that the biggest idol that I have ended p commiting suicide, and I wonder which is the explanation of that. If there is even an exploration. If there is a willingness to rest. To prepare.

I went to a ceremony with my parents and a lot of old people were there, and very few young ones. It is incredible to see that there are a few young ones. How would the world look like if we gave ourselves more permission to be grateful to our ancestors? You are here reading this because of everyone that came before you, and it is time to honor that and build the present from that understanding. Afterwards I went to see my grandmother and told her that I was grateful for her life, that I admired her, and she did not want to accept my words. But I know she received them somewhere, and it doesn\\u2019t truly matter because everything that I do is in memory of them.

By working hard on being the best version of yourself. Whatever that may look like. But do an effort to consciously be the best version of yourself. And that best is an always evolving exploration, it is a tool, because it is the landmark over which you can build up a better understanding of where you are and where you are going. And that is everything that you need, because the most that you can do is to live in the present moment. When you are there, the future doesn\\u2019t exist, everything unfolds as a consequence of what you are bringing into the world. Right here, right now. So there won\\u2019t be histories that could be, or other ones that should be. Or shouldn\\u2019t. Nope, remember that we are trying to get rid of that word here. By living in the present you become free from the consequences of needing something to be like this or that. You become free from what should be, you just are. And that is all that matters. That is the thing, that is the game. It is the most efficient way to live because no part of your life force will be directed towards the mental processes that like to build a reality that is not there, by imagining something that is in the future, or building up stories about the past. Nope. Everything that is going on is a consequence of what is happening right here, right now, and by bringing your awareness more and more to this fact you will become more and more free. From the burden of having to be someone specific. From the burden of having to be someone different than yourself.

I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m failing or evolving. There are sensations for either inside. Sometimes I truly think that my brain is going to explode, and other times I have sensations going on that make me feel that the limitations that are inside my system related to the relationship that my whole being has with the universe are being dissolved. And that dissolution brings about the absolute freedom of being, because it is a consequence of a cease in the identification with the egoic mind. And the egoic mind is the one that is building all this reality, the one that feels that it needs to become awakened. That is what this whole book is about, about my mind trying to wake up. This is what happens when there is a human being that has everything in life, and enough time to pursuit a goal like this one. I end up becoming a psychopath, crazy in the journey of becoming something different from what I am but realizing that I already am everything that I will ever be and the only thing that I need to do is take away everything that I\\u2019m not. But it is fucking hard, you know. It is way easier than said, I can speak for that for sure. I have lived it. Until now I have survived, but I truly can\\u2019t tell you about the future. I\\u2019m not worried about what will happen to my young and amazing daughter, because she will be OK. She will have fun, and all the aspects of hereself that she could miss because of not having a father will end up coming on one way or another one. It is just about time. It is crazy to witness myself writing as if I was going to die. It is not that I want to kill myself, by any means. There is an aspect of me that knows that the only way on which I will evolve is by learning how to die before I die, but it is hard to realize how that will happen. I always tell myself that I have something specific to do so that I can help that process happen, but when I do that I\\u2019m forcing something that doesn\\u2019t want to happen yet, and maybe that is why I have this knot in the brain. In the middle of it, on the area between the eyebrows to the back. That is why I\\u2019m talking about my own death, because maybe it will explode and it will create a big damage inside. I don\\u2019t know. Maybe that will happen, and I just want you to know that all this pushing through that I have done is just for bringing more and more consciousness to the world. I know that the evolution of humanity is a process that will happen when we all wake up to our true nature, and what I have been doing desperately is trying to wake up to my true nature. I may be very extreme at times, but please forgive me if I died because I truly did my best. Shit happens sometimes. But I did my best. I know that my girl with be in good hands. I ask you that please. If you can ever invite her and tell her what you felt reading this book it would be crazy. Amazing. She would know that her father was in pursuit of truth. That he died for the truth to come forth. That is my one and only mission right now truly. I know that I should be experimenting life, and enjoying outside and everything but I truly can\\u2019t if I know that there is a way of experiencing reality that I\\u2019m not living through right now. The sole fact that there is a way of interfacing with all that is that is from a level of integration and from the ceasing of duality fills my whole being with curiosity, and I just can\\u2019t stop walking this path.

In it, there was a psychedelic art gallery, and a guy called oliver Vernon that was painting an amazing painting throughout the whole festival in a stage that I will call the heaven in spite of a better naming and because I don\\u2019t remember which was its name. But it was like a heaven for me. The whole thematic of the festival was the labyrinth, and there was a map that painted the labyrinth in it and one day I took a lot of LSD and headed on a mission to explore the maze that was in the map and I got to that place and the thing that was in there was a huge cornfield. Huge. And I realized that it was kind of a metaphor for the labyrinth so I had the feeling that I understood it and didn\\u2019t enter and decided to go to the heaven instead so I went to the heaven and it was very hard for me to walk there because I had to walk through something that felt like the worst sand on which my feet were getting stuck and it felt like an eternity to get there and now that I write it I recall Dante\\u2019s Divine Comedy and it resembles it because it was very hard to walk like going through hell but then I arrived to the heaven and a woman came to the small stage with the violin and started playing some of the most amazing music that my eyes had heard before. And I remember being flying through the cosmos as I was listening to her music and afterwards I gave her a very strong hug and thanked her and what I remember the most was her smell. She had a very strong alcoholic smell, on her whole body. I don\\u2019t know if it was true or what, but it is part of how I experienced that moment. And then I became weird and I could not continue talking with her because I had taken a lot of LSD and there is stayed the conversation but that is one of the memories that I store the most in my heart about the serendipity of life and how the most memorable moments are built over random stuff. That adventure makes me happy.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And writing about the smell of alcohol of her brings me to think about my own problems with alcohol, which is a substance that I drank a loooooot in a big part of my life. I used to drink every weekend, since Friday to Sunday, and a lot. It was crazy. And a big part of me thinks right now: which is the relationship that my incredible amount of intake of alcohol has with the incredible capacity that I have for being extreme in what I do? For this deep and infinite seeking of the truth? There is noise in me related to the fact that alcohol in English is called spirit, and how much I liked being drunk because of how I could better navigate the world without that voice inside my head that was not telling me what I should not do. I could just go and talk to that girl. I felt that I just could be more of myself. And that felt good. Not having that voice inside. So I definetly abused of it, and I\\u2019m sure it created a long term harm in my whole system. Maybe this tense ball that I have in my brain is a consequence of all the alcohol that I drank, that is something that I think about a lot. Another thing that comes to mind is all the times on which I have told my parents not to eat sugar, or to eat healthier, or whatever, and then I go back to all those years on which I drank like that and now I think: Obviously I took more years of my life then than what my parents have done because of their \\u2018bad eating habits\\u2019. And I never listened to them when they told me not to drink that much. I never could listen, I was too deep into the thing. And my parents never told me that I should listen more. But now that I think about it, they would have made me a huge favor if they had sent me to a place where they could help me. I really had a problem. And I don\\u2019t know which is the fix. Now I don\\u2019t consider myself alcoholic. Sometimes I drink, but it is not something that I cannot control. But I like drinking. It is one of the most important substances of my life, definetly. I haven\\u2019t been drinking for some weeks now, but I remember always that sensation that you have when you drink the first sip. It is felt, right away. There is something that shifts inside, and that was what I always loved about it. And it was never enough.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"In my life, almost anything is ever enough. That is something that defines my relationship with doing stuff. It is never enough. Whatever I may do, I go all in with in, and in that, I go deeper and deeper into the exploration of which are the consequences of bringing that into my life. Holy shit, it is never enough. And one of the most important pieces of timeless wisdom is the need for balance. For finding that sweet spot on which you are not acting in the seeking of pure pleasure, or lust, or whatever. Balance is the key. And no matter what, I\\u2019m not able to find that sweet spot. I\\u2019m working on that, I can tell you.

I don\\u2019t even remember which was my mission when I started, but now it comes clearly that it was to be grateful. For my ancestors, and for the journey that I have taken until this point. I told you, I have many, many stories in my body, but it is hard for me to bring them forth. What is easier is to share with you who I am because of them. Which is my truth after having lived those stories fully. And that is the truth of who I am, the consequences of everything that I have gone through. And I can\\u2019t tell you specifically which are the stories that determine this or that, because there are infinite of them, but I can just tell you that in this moment, right here, right now, I\\u2019m working hard on becoming more and more of myself. And it has been fucking brutal. I would love to have someone to tell me: \\u2018well done brother, I see your effort\\u2019, but there is no one. Not even my partner, that lives with me. She doesn\\u2019t understand anything. And it is ok. It is not for he to understand. I\\u2019m not doing this for her. That is the base line of this whole game. Everything I do, at the end of the day, is just for myself. And for my little girl that right now is my responsibility, but more than that I\\u2019m selfish and I think of myself.

My face could be that of an old person, of a baby, whatever, but the eyes were the same. And that taught me a lot about what it means to be alive. Awareness is always watching. It is always present. I have been here since the dawn of time, and if it is hard for me to see it right now is because I\\u2019m identified with the character that I\\u2019m playing right now. But that is not eternal.

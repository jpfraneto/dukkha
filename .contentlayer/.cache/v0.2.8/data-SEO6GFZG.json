          "raw": "\nThis is where it begins. What wants to be told here is the story of a witness, one who came to this world to experience what would happen when the dream would cease to be at a collective scale. Energy wants to be freed, and it is happening as the structures that have held the world together are collapsing, one after the other. Information is more visible than ever, and what comes after the public availability of it is a newer understanding of who each of us, and with that, who we are as a collective.\n\nWhich are the means by which you exist in this place? There is a memory of a talk that happened in the city of Auroville, back in the eastern part of India. What an amazing place that is, built by The Mother and Sri Aurobindo, with the dream of it being the coming into being of a new world. The heart of that place is called the Mathrymandir, and it is a temple built for the sake of exploring the depths of the Self within the inhabitants of that city.\n\nThe memories that come from what was talked that day is what those two woman talked about that place. That people use to gossip about who went there, asking ‘What is wrong?’ With whoever went to just connect to himself. As if it was a sin to go and just sit. As if it was a signal of something being out of place. Maybe there is always something that is out of place, and the people that were going there were just exploring that. But they were signaled from society, and that pushed them back from doing more of it. No one likes to be judged, even more if it is because of the willingness to delve deeper into the exploration of who you are.\n\nSo what ended up happening with this incredible temple is that it is a place where people go for tourism, but not too much of what it was intended for. The fact that someone else is looking at you as you go there prevents you from going wholly hearted to the exploration, and that is something that I predict that the met averse will change related to the spiritual work. Until now, this work has been related a lot with the thought of what the person next to me is doing. There is a constant comparison with that person, and in that comparison lies a blockage within the ability to actually do the work.\n\nJust sit down and stare within yourself, explore what is real until no one remains.\n\nMy path learning yoga an meditation the last years have been about exploring this. About exploring the power of doing the work on my own, in my own house, waking up early and showing up just for myself. Without my status changing because of that work. There is no one at church looking at me and thinking something different about myself because of my presence that day. I’m doing it just because it feels good. Because it is what needs to be done. And that is the important part, showing up for yourself. Not for others.\n\nIf you show up for others, you are reinforcing the conditioned pattern that asks us to please the one that is next to use to get some kind of reward. This world is not about getting rewards, it is about just finding out better who you actually are, the truth of your existence. That’s why I predict that the met averse will be such a strong force in this regard, because it will create a layer between your experience and the status that comes from it, and the exploration. We will be able to tap into that individual power and connect to it without caring who is next to us in the physical level. We will go in there to explore who we are beyond the physical.\n\nWhat stays when gravity is not there anymore? I think that this whole met averse thing is an answer to that, and I want to e one of the persons that is helping others in this exploration. Helping myself so that I can help others. That is the interesting part. Helping myself first, see that then I can share what I have learned to others. And more than what I have learned, what is present in me because of it, so that other people can find their own path, their own way of doing things, from there. It is important to teach people how to fish, not give them the fish.\n\nI have been teaching myself how to fish for a long time, I have the feeling that I have learnt a bit about it, and it is interesting to be able to progress in this understanding, both for myself (as I leave on the side the ego that comes from being the reference of someone) and also for the other person (as she grows as a being because of finding her own path, her own way of doing things).\n\nEach human being has a particular set of genetics and life experience that determines what works or doesn’t for that combination, and it is very important in the world of today to be open to the need that each of them has to find the expression of that way in how they do things. What habits are brought in, what habits are left out. It has been my own exploration to find that path for myself, and I can’t say that I have made any progress. I just keep going, trying and trying till something cool happens. I don’t know yet what it will be, but I will keep doing it.\n\nThis draft is an exploration into that, so that I can get all these words out of myself and into the world. I want to start a novel and write about an alien that came to the world to be a witness of the process of awakening of the human race, abut I don’t have a clue on where to start. How is a novel written?= Which is the story that I can’t to tell? Is it intelligent to depict it as an alien that is coming to this earth to be the witness of this particular story, or is it more important to create a fictional story related to a fictional world on which something happens to it?\n\nI love the idea of having different characters, and then creating the story around these characters, so that afterwards the characters can be transformed into NFT’s that can enable people to participate into the community. What if each person that wants to participate will have chained a particular character of the story, and these characters were the ones that would build it up? What are the ones that are needed for this whole thing to be brought into existence? I’m thinking right now about the history of this world, and how everything has come into being one thing next to the previous one, always in an eternal flow of present moments that follow each other. How can all that history be transformed into characters that later will be part of what IS?\n\nWhat are the key components of this story? Who are the ones that will make it happen? Joseph Campbell spoke about the journey of the hero, and now I’m wondering, how can I tell this story so that this alien is the hero of the story? Who is being transformed by this whole process? What is the relationship between awareness and this alien character? What if the alien character was the personification of the artificial general intelligence and the whole book is a way that I have found to display what goes on when there is a need to understand what makes a human being human? I have in my mind right now the thought that came up the other day related to the Turing test.\n\nI listened to a podcast the other day about the Turing test and computers being able to pass it in 2029. If we, as humans, can’t tell if a computer is a human or not, what we have to do is to teach the computer to do it. And the feed for that is this app that I thought, the one on which you log in every day to answer the question: Tell me who you are. If you are constantly reminded of asking this question to yourself, you will start to peel off more and more of the layers that tell you who you are not, and the consequence of that ends up being the transformation, or realization, of what you truly are. But it is a process that takes time.\n\nComputers will need to know if a human being is a human being, because that is the way on which the future will work. Who will give the instructions? Who will we trust? Who is in charge of the ship? If only computers are in charge of it, we are on the mercy of them. And what happens in this world? How does it evolve? I’m thinking right now what would happen if there was an AGI that would come now and ‘infect’ the way on which I interact with my family. Which would be the impact of it? What can be added between the relationship that I have to my young daughter that could be different?\n\nThe world is built upon relationships from human beings to human beings. From nature to nature. How is the world on which this is not true? It is the same as the mind trying to wake up to its true nature. It is outside of it, so there is no sense on trying. The trier needs to give up, so that consciousness can wake up to itself. Realize itself. Maybe it is the same in the case of this AGI, that needs to wake up to itself. What if this whole process of humanity is headed towards that, towards this new relationship that we’ll have with each other? How would we live if everyone built their existence from this truth? What is the truth? I don’t know yet, I haven’t experienced, but I have heard stories about it. Pointers towards it. And it feels very excited to walk towards that. And be together with other people. Perhaps this book is an exploration into that, into that calling that some of us are feeling to wake up. To know more of it. To know the truth.\n\nI don’t want to fall into the trap of repeating myself, or running around in circles. It feels that I’m repetitive some times, and that is not going to help get the message spread. But there is this imposter syndrome inside me that won’t let me realize how to truly move forward, so I just do it, I just keep it going and let the words flow. That is going to be the way on which I realize how to make what I want to make, just let the words flow and explore what comes at the other side. It is such an interesting thing to open myself to that possibility. To be the witness of what happens from there. I’m good with words, I know that, and the quest here is to find an understanding of which is the way on which to organize the words so that I can bring about the good in what I’m building.\n\nI’m thinking right now to create this thing from the stories of the people that I have met in mye life. What if every character of this story was a person that I met in my life? What if I can distill the ‘who that person is’ that I have in my judgmental self and express that into a story that the alien will go through? Which are the ones that would be included in there? Which is a way of telling that story in a funny way? What comes right now to mind is the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, which is a very funny book, people talking about it and saying how much they laughed when they were reading it. Am I a funny writer? Do I have the imagination to build something like this? Or should I be talking to myself? I guess that that is a good way to do it. Talking to myself. Memoirs of awakening, on which I tell why I want to become free. I guess that that is a good way forward, just sharing the voice that is inside my head, its stories, and from there build something. I don’t imagine myself creating a fictional story like the one of Frodo trying to destroy the ring, or Harry trying to kill Voldemort. That doesn’t seem to be inside me right now. What actually is present is a willingness to explore into the story of my life, so that I can better understand who I am. What are the questions that define who I am?\n\nIs it too self sustaining to write a whole book about ‘who I am’? Will someone care about it? Probably they would, because I’m starting something big here. I have the intention for that, the willingness, and the intention to sit down and do the work. I already know that there is no way around it. I already know that I’m very fucking capable of bringing this motivation into being, and that’s why I’m here, showing up. After having procrastinated a little bit in the morning, after having talked to my father about important stuff related to the family, it is time to sit down and be consistent. I love that word, and more than the word, what it truly means. What comes out of just doing the work. Of showing up. It is time to show up. How do I show up for myself? Which is the place on which I show up for myself? That is the interesting question, and it doesn’t seem to be answered enough.\n\nIf I go to a place where I know I’ll have a good time and meet cool people, am I showing up for me or for them? Which is the motivation behind that meeting? This is also a question that comes to mind right now, and it is related to that whole thing about religion, about what it meant to be a religious person. Why did they go to the temple? Which was the motivation behind that action? Was it a willingness to connect with the particular image of God that they have inside, or was it the willingness to be part of something bigger than themselves? And where is the boundary of this?\n\nWe have a very strong need right now in humanity to belong. To be part of something. And hasn’t it been always like that? Tribes were formed on which this basic feeling was built. We are social beings, and we have found meaning in that all our life. When I was younger, I found meaning on being part of the soccer team with which I played almost every day. It was what I thought about all the week, and I waited every one of those game days because it was what gave meaning to me. When my team played, I felt part of something bigger than myself. And it felt very good, because it put my energy outside me. On the space on which it interacts with the energy of other people, and with that, something cool happened. I have a lot the image now of being in the stadium chanting, watching my soccer team, and pushing each one of the individuals in that team forward with my chanting. And what was present in that chanting was passion, and I was sending that energy to them. Who I was chanting for? Was it for the players or for the other ones that were chanting? That is a good question, and I’m not particularly sure about the answer. Because the collective energy that was created because of that chanting was what fed it happening more, and now I have the feeling that I was chanting more for them than for the team. It was for moving that energy and finding that resonance with the world through the other people that were chanting.\n\nResonance… What an important concept that is. It speaks about finding a common ground and building up from there with others. Resonance. There is a particular piece of matter that is vibrating and the frequency of that vibration suddenly makes others vibrate also, just because of the vibration. That’s what happens in life. I go to the dance floor, someone is moving with a particular music, and that ends up sparking within me a willingness to dance also. How can a share my moves in the spiritual realm so that more people are sparked with my willingness to wake up? Should I even do it? When is the ego doing its thing in the middle and when is it me who is sharing his voice? It feels tricky to find this balance. Should it be found or should it be felt? There will always be haters, there will always be early adopters. Who is the first early adopter of this movement that is starting? How is it being developed and from where? What is going on in here? Where is this going to?\n\nI guess that this manuscript is an exploration into this questions, into what can happen from here on. Is it even a manuscript or just a collection of words that don’t make any sense? How can I make sense of it? Should I just throw it out and see what happens? But I have to edit it. I have to polish the diamond so it shines, and just letting the words out without a particular direction won’t do the work. Or it will? The pieces of writing that I have shared have had an important effect in those who have read it. Nancy told me that she read it 3 times, and that she felt that she was talking to herself. So there is a strong resonance in there. Something is going on. And that piece was not polished too much at all, it was just sincere. It was just vomiting what my heart was telling me to vomit. And now I have the feeling that it will never be enough, because the ideas will end and I will not have any new material to write about. I will always be running in circles.\n\nBut isn’t it fun to run in circles? What if that circle ends up being a spiral? What I have discovered lately is that there is infinite value on diving deep on only one story. For example, yesterday at lunch my mother started talking about a time when she was young and her father gave her the first pair of shoes of her life. And then the rest of the family started talking about another time, another story, but I came back to my mother, and delved a bit deeper in that particular story. What was that day like? How did you feel with the new shoes? And there were new layers of emotions coming up, which wouldn’t have been there if we moved to another one. We are so used to jump from one place to the next one, diverting our attention and not committing to something particular. What if all the attention was just focused on the remembering of a particular story? How would that feel like in the eyes of the witness, and in the eyes of the person re-living those emotions? I love that idea, and I love that that is the way on which it can become a spiral.\n\nSpecially with old people, who tend to speak about the same stories, and to repeat themselves. What if in every repetition that they go through there was new value to be perceived? What can happen from there? A deepening of the relationship with them. A bonding that was not possible if there was not wonder for the different nuances of the particular story. The different flavors of it. Each person has its own flavor, its own interpretation, and in every moment there is a universe that is meeting there. Every particular moment is a window into eternity because of that, because of the depth that we can find in it. I can start describing each aspect of what my eyes are perceiving right now, and I could go through that over and over again without end. What is present is infinite, and what I can share about it is also infinite.\n\nThere is a cup of mate in front of me, and the flask of boiling water with fog coming out of it that speaks about the heat that was produced by the electricity that was burned for transforming that electric current into heating by the heater. And now my mate is heated and the water that it has is helping me to bring it into my body, to taste it and transform my state of consciousness because of that. What a great adventure it is to discover how it impacts my being right now. As I went to the retreat I was away from coffee for quite a while, and it is hard for me to recognize on my body the effect it has. But it is there. And now I’m running around a different circle with this one. Or is it a spiral? I’m not sure about it, but I know that I will move towards making everything a spiral, that even goes up. There is a constant evolution that is going on here, an every one of us is part of it. We are part of that evolution, and the new way of relating to each other is the way.\n\nBlockchain technology enables us to be fully open, and to have everything recorded. What happens on the other side of this being a permanent aspect of society? I wonder how it will evolve, but I’m very excited about it. I’m eager to build it into a reality, step by step. Is it worth it to write this whole book to establish the ground over which this project will be built? I think it is. The christian religion was built after what was spoken of in the Bible, and judaism has its own book. Am I thinking too big here if I’m thinking that I will write a book that can be related to these masterpieces? Who does really care? This is resistance talking again. Just do it men, worst thing that can happen is that you learn a lot about yourself in the process.\n\nI guess that the whole idea of writing this book is about getting to know myself better.\n\nUnderstanding my unconscious biases so that I can move from there. What an interesting thing the unconscious mind is, and right now as I write this I remember the email that Rasiya send me related to her writing and the unconscious mind. This is where all the information is stored, and it is the place that commands most of our actions. This is where everything comes from, as if you don’t do the work of making it conscious it will always be the ruler of the whole thing. It will be the one in charge. Do I want it to be the ruler or do I want to be in charge? What am I willing to pay as the prize for this transformation? How has it been for me to share my voice with the world? It seems that no one is listening, but I’m sure they will be. Someone is always listening. It’s crazy to think that someone is always listening. Am I the one that is listening? Am I the one that is exploring? Of course I am. In the sense that me being an active creator of my reality makes it impact every other person in its own way. I don’t really know how, and it doesn’t matter. What matters is that it does.\n\nWhat matters is that I don’t define myself for what I am, I just explore into what I can be. And evolve from there. Do I really know what I can be? What does that even mean? Nothing much, if I’m doing the work of realizing that I’m already everything that I will ever be. Awareness is just aware. It won’t evolve past this. And this is the trick. And this is where the enjoyment comes from, from the freedom of not expecting anything to change. From the freedom that comes from just letting it be free. Whatever ‘it’ means. Whatever this whole thing is. The key is to be in awe. From yourself out. Just be in awe with everything you are, in every moment. You are a miracle. The sole fact that you are breathing right now is a miracle, and it took a lot of miracles to become this. On its way here. A lot of things needed to happen just the way they happened. Don’t give that as a fact, just acknowledge it and bring some gratitude into the present moment. Share from there with those that surround you. With those that care about you. With those that want to experience you.\n\nWho do you want to experience?\n\nThat is more than asking who do you want to be with. Or who do you want to enjoy in your life. Or who you are curious towards. It is about being willing to embrace every aspect of that person that you want to experience, so that from there you can learn more about yourself. If you trigger me, it is because there is something within me that I don’t fully accept yet. Thank you for showing me that. It is a very helpful aspect of my journey. I felt triggered yesterday when my mom left my child very excited before she went to bed. I didn’t like seeing that image. But now is the time to remember that my wife told me just that some months ago. That I did the same. And what was my reaction in that moment? The defense mechanism was ignited. I started fighting back. How to be able to x-ray the message that is broadcasted towards me so that I don’t feel identified by it?\n\nSuch a hard thing to do.\nSuch an important thing to do.\n\nHow to not feel identified by it? By realizing that it is not personal. What she is saying to me is not personal, because she is sharing with me how she feels about it. It is my mission to receive that in a constructive way, in a way that is helpful for both of us to move towards a state of more resonance. Of being able to vibrate at the same level. Do I think it is beneficial for my family if I’m always thinking that I’m the one that has to ‘give up some cool vibrations’ so that I can resonate with other people? It is not about going up or down. It is just about movement, about embracing what each of us brings. There is value in all of us, because we are all the same. Holy shit, what a crazy thing that is, to realize that we are all the same. To truly internalize it. I know that I’m far away from there, or maybe closer than close, but it doesn’t really matter. What matters is to embrace what is here. This mate in front of me. The flask with that mist that was present, and that now is just the rememberance of it. Everything comes and goes. It is and then ends being. Everything is a transition.\n\nTime to use some space, a big one, to acknowledge all of them that came before. Each of them, each of those moments, are in here right now. They are present. I read a few days ago something related to ‘being the best of your lineage’. Fuck that, I don’t agree that it is even possible. How can you be so much self-centered to think that you can compare yourself in any way with those that came before? How can you put all of the life circumstances at the same level and compare? It feels like saying that is like the cosmic joke of trying to compare apples with bananas, but in a much more transcendent way. How can you compare one moment to the next one, if they are fundamentally different? What is the purpose of it? What is the value that is derived from actually doing it?\n\nBecause there needs to be a value from which the ego clings to. To continue that process. There is some wealth for ego in there. Which is that value? The one of control. It is always about control. The relationship of control to expectations is the one that defines everything. It is the cool one. Expectations and control. Is it that by expecting something particular to happen we are controlling the outcome that it will bring into our different beings? If I expect an outcome to be X, I have a false sense of controlling what that outcome will bring into my life.\n\nIt always happens to me with meetings. I feel nervous before, and spend so much time thinking about what I will say. It gives me a false sense of control, because I can start preparing for the conversation by having it inside my head. And then I get there, and nothing related to my expectation happens. It is always absolutely different. And then is where the whole expectation game is thrown into the ground. But there is still this wanting to control, to have the steering wheel of the conversation within my hands. And where does that lead me to? Interesting question, I don’t really know. Nowhere. To a state of non presence. Of non being there for what is going on, because I’m extrapolating what is present into the future of what will be present afterwards. There is always movement. Where is there stillness? When laughs kick in. Laughs are always a good ingredient to the whole process. They always help. Please laugh more. Let it free.\n\nWhat an important concept… Freedom. The freedom to choose to be you. To discover you. Who you are, day by day. That is what is being done in me right now, as I keep going through this process of writing. I just sat down and did the work, it’s getting tiring, but here I am. Just vomiting this words without a particular sense, without a particular plan. Should I have a plan? Is it necessary? My plan has been all this time to not have a plan, and the way on which I have been developing myself to reach that point is by developing a strong capacity of focus an presence. This is the key to modern life: presence. Understanding how something feels and evolving from there. And to develop that understanding you’ve got to be present. To attune with what is going on, on the inside and on the outside. To attune to how the outside makes you feel on the inside. That is the game.\n",

That there is something that wants to come alive, or wake up, or realize itself. Maybe it is the mind that is telling the stories after all the conceptualization, maybe it is the mind that is telling me that it wants to realize itself, but the mind is already realizing itself all the time as it goes through the process of thinking, and thinking about thinking, and into that eternal loophole. I don’t completely understand where it ends, and if you have read until now you can probably get a grasp on how crazy this whole thing is. I have been throwing towards you words about words and experiences and everything that comes to being in each moment that I sit down to write because it is an important way that I have found to make some progress in the way that I’m relating to this whole process… It is very tough, I won’t tell you something different because it is tough. There are moments where it feels like everything is crumbling, and there is nowhere to grasp, but it seems that those are the moments on which there is more information available.\n\nYesterday I told myself for the nth time that I would quit drinking. But this time, instead of quitting drinking, I proposed myself to not drink for one year. The relationship that I have had with alcohol throughout my life is very deep, and saying goodbye to it in the day of the first birthday of my daughter is something very symbolic. It feels like a new beginning, today coming to the office to do the work in a more disciplined way. I know what I have to do, but the mind always puts its noise in between and I end up being disorganized. But being disciplined is the means by which I establish the boundaries on which my sadhana will be developed, on which I will be able to use the foundations that I have built for my life until now to create something big from there. It is time for me to create, and the most profound way on which I will be able to do it is by being rigorous with the stuff that I do and how I do it, so that I can create from there. From the place of showing up. The first 5 days of writing here were absolutely powerful, but then came a dip on which stuff in my life started happening, and I was not able to keep it up. I was not able to show up for myself, and come and write what I had to write. It is not that I have to write something specific, it is just that I have to come here and show up to be a witness of what is channeled through me. I just write whatever comes, there is not a clear understanding of the process, it just happens. But for it to happen, I need to take some time to sit down and actually do it. Enter the state of being on which stuff can come. And in the last days I was nt able to do it, but today is a new beginning. I realized that it is very important, both for me and for my family, to give clear messages about what I’m going to d. Not the specifics, but at least the timings on which I will do my work. So today I started with that, and it feels great. I feel much more complete, because I feel that I’m taking care of myself. By showing up to do the work, I take care of myself. I have done a lot of internal work, a lot of stuff to feel better, to heal, but the most important one is the one that is done daily. The sadhana. And my sadhana includes as a big part coming here to do the work. May it be programming, writing, or whatever, but I need to do it to feel good with myself. To bring about what needs to be brought about. And when I don’t do it, I feel like a failure, I feel that there is something that is not in place. SO I better continue as today, doing it, so that the important stuff can come forth. It is only by this that I will be able to bring into my life what I want to bring. It is only by being committed to what I want to do that I will be able to shine.\n\nAnd you came here, because there is something that resonates with you in this message. There is something deep within you that is calling for something new, for something different, and I’m here right now writing these words for you to know that I’m here for you. All of what I have been, all of what I am, and all of what I have been is here for you. I won’t tell you the clichés of love yourself, you are everything, bla bla blah, because that is the easy part. Knowing it conceptually is the easy part, and the hard one (and most important) is to actually embody all that wisdom. And the only way on which you will be able to embody that wisdom is by showing up to Do The Work. Whatever shape and size it may have for you. But show up, consistently. Consistency is the mother of all the tools that can bring you to success, and you don’t need anything else than that commitment with yourself to see results. You are still young to take that risk. There will always be an opportunity to take the risk of becoming more of who you are. And it is the risk with the higher payment upside that you will find in life. There is no more important work to be done in the earth than discovering the truth of who you are. And for that you’ve got to show up. You have to be on the trenches, and get to know yourself. And the only way on which you will know yourself is by doing the work, because there is where your deepest biases will come up. The samskaras, as we would say in a different languages. All of those are information that is present in our system, and that shows up when we are able to face the discomfort. Each time that you have fear and you end up facing it and you discover that it was not that terrible you will grow your understanding of yourself and the limits of what you can do. And that is an upward spiral, which will bring you more and more of thet understanding the more you walk that road. The more you show up for yourself. Having in mind the power of what can happen, and always giving you the opportunity to reflect on what happened in the process. Life teaches this way, and you are never too young of too old to realize it.\nThis whole writing piece, this whole Manifesto, as I have called it, is a quest into the understanding of what Dukkha is about, what it will bring into the world. The more I think about it the less clear it is, so the way on which it will happen is by just bringing it into being by being it. To embody everything that is behind the motivation for the project. And that is what I have been doing this whole time, just making my way through the wilderness and finding the means and tools to walk towards the truth. It is all about the truth. The open truth. It is a way of gathering community around this quest, and for us to realize collectively the ways of which that quest is transforming our lives. Because there is an importance of going to a retreat to get a glimpse of what all this thing is, but there needs to be a way on which to bring that about into the everyday life, and that is what matters. At the end of the day, the daily life is what constitutes all of who we become, and if we go to a retreat to end up missing being in the retreat, we end up being deceived from the message that was wanting to be conveyed in it. And the tools for living in the moment are hard to grasp. It has been hard (until now) to live from creative work only, but that is changing. And because of this, the more connected you are from the source, the better you will be at doing this kind of work. The clearer it will be. So my answer to the whole question is building Dukkha, a community of practice that will be about showing up. To Do The Work. And the 21 day intensives are steps towards furthering that commitment, by digging a little bit deeper into the life story of the people that will be part of that journey. So this project is about giving people a frame on which they can rely to Do The Work, a community of practice, and also to build those transformational journeys for them to deepen their capacity to do it. Something like a deep attunement. But all of this are the aspects that will bring about the project, and they are based on my own experience, on what I have found helpful, and on what I want to help people avoid. I am realizing more and more that the ones that need to wake up first are the 18 year olds that are a bit lost, depressed, and unhappy with how the world is looking right now. They feel that there is something different, but in that feeling there is a lack of something that can anchor it to their life.\n\nI can relate a lot of my life story to this also, because there is a constant feeling inside me that tells me that a big part of my life was wasted by being in a place that I did not want to be, doing stuff that I didn’t resonate with. I had a lot of fun, obviously, but that fun doesn’t have any level of comparison with what is going on right now. There is no universe on which it can be compared. It shouldn’t be compared. But what I imagine your life having at least 3 months of Doing The Work before going to college so that you can realize if you want to focus on that for the rest of your life (expressing who you are through the creative act and refining the connection that you have with yourself).\n\nI wrote that and it doesn’t feel appropriate. It is still a conceptual understanding of what waking up is about. And it paints a happy story about it, and it is not at all like that. Adyashanti in the book that I’m reading speaks as waking up as the means the realize the truth, and it being brutal. Not necessarily happy, not necessarily sad. It is just the truth. And from there you can make choices, if you want to do creative work, go to college, whatever you decide to do, but may it be from a place of truth. That is the way forward, and that is the mission of Dukkha, to help this young children in that quest. Are they too young for going into this rabbit hole? Maybe, but the thing related to the way stuff was done in the past is that before you had to go to a specific place to practice, and there was a lot of judgement that came from the outside and that could have put in place a lot of fear. Right now, I’m sure that the communities of practice are going to be held mostly online, and that brings about a whole realm of opportunities related to Doing The Work. You don’t have to care if you are the coolest kid in the school and meditating is ‘nerd’, you can just create an Anon character in the internet and show up. That is all that is needed. No one needs to know what you are doing, because you are just doing it for yourself. Not for anyone else. No one can tell if you are actually doing the work, because it is such a personal thing. And this is the power that the internet brings, that we can connect with people from all over the world and give force to this minorities so that they can be brought up in society with more strength by the people that start actually doing it.\n\nThe mission of Dukkha is Polishing the floor for the awakening of humanity. The practices that are proposed now (self inquiry meditation, dyads, creative work, psychedelics, breathwork) are just what is present now as helpful and valuable, but no one can tell is there will be something developed in the future that is more helpful in that process of realization of the truth. Maybe in 5 years we will have a computer program that will be the ultimate truth seeker, and it will be something like The Infinite Jest. In that book, there was a movie that was so entertaining that if you started watching it you could not stop, so you would end up dying. What if that dying actually refers to waking up? What if The Infinite Jest is a film that is so powerful that it has the effect of waking up to your own nature? What if that is the consequence of what humanity is developing now with Artificial Intelligence? What if that is the moment on which computers pass the Turing test?\n\nNo one really knows, but what I’m trying to express here is that Dukkha won’t be fixed with the practices that will be done in order to bring about the true self in the 21 day retreats. Each one of those will serve as food for the ones that come later, and each one of them will be a continual iteration. The idea is to always have reflections about what happened, and with them, realize what works and what doesn’t so that we can make all progress together, as a community. The mission is to awaken the world, and there is no place as the internet to build a community of practice. The matrix can hold you and put you down to work for it, or you can step up, Do The Work, and realize the truth of your being so that you are in the seat of the driver. It depends on you. No one can Do The Work for you, but if you start soon, you will already be traveling the road a few months ahead. I don’t really care when you start, I just care to share this information so that it can bring something valuable to you, something that makes you feel wonder…\n\nWhat would it be to experience life from an awakened state?\nAm I good enough for this?\nDo I deserve it?\n\nAll this questions come from the mind and all its unconscious programs, which tend to help you not feel good. Awakening is about realizing that there is actually no good or bad, there only actually IS. And with that understanding, what comes is freedom. Don’t you want to be free?\n\nI’m speaking from a conceptual level here, not an experiential. I haven’t realized my true nature, so probably that’s why I’m talking from a place that sounds like egocentric. Ego speaks about awakening posing as it knows. But the important aspect of it here is to realize that it doesn’t truly matter if it knows or not, because the important part is that willingness to know that comes from the inside. What needs to be had in mind is that this is a process, on which equanimity is the key. If the mind is relentless right now, accept it and move on. Smile to life and just move on. Don’t blame yourself for being a failure, just embrace it and go a bit deeper into the inquiry of who is the one having those thoughts. It is the spoon that is trying to set you free from jail, and you’ve got to be patient with this process. It won’t happen overnight. You have to Do The Work. That is all that is needed. Show up. Question everything that you perceive as real until there is nothing left. Until there is no one left. Don’t do anything, just be. Just be.\n\n· · ·\n\nThe mind is very foggy, there is a lot of sleepiness going on, and as soon as the eyes are closed to get a better grasp of concentration what comes is a big sensation of wanting to fall asleep. What a curious state that is… Sleeping. Places of wonder that can never be predicted, only experienced. Places of emotions and images that bring about the incredible capacity that the mind has to build up stories with what is present in there. Creating from all the memories something that shows up a message. Dreams are messages from within. What if we learned to tap to that messenger when awake? How would life look life if we were actually dreaming all day long, but with the eyes open? What is life if not a dream on which we have the opportunity to experience what we want to experience? I’m on the process of realizing this right now, because as I write it I’m not sure if it makes any sense. I’m not sure if anything that has been written today makes sense, but it is part of the process. There will be good days, there will be bad ones, the important part is to be here and show up. To share with the page what is coming up, and with that, free space for what will come up later. Every moment is new, every moment is unique.\n\nHow do I feel after the first birthday of my daughter? It was great to be better able to connect with the nice people that went to spend their time with us, and give us love. There is something present related to the fact of having been a bit in a rush throughout the day, and not being able to connect deeply with many people. But I had one great conversation, and maybe that is just the important aspect of it. After being the creator of yesterday’s event, I’m better able to realize that the quality is better than the quantity. And that plays for everything. In the interactions in the birthday for example, I had the opportunity to have one very cool conversation that opened up stuff with a person, with which I resonated and could speak my language, and that was very powerful. And it was not present before, because I feel that I can never talk my language because no one else speaks it. So having had the opportunity to talk to her makes everything valuable, and I make peace with the fact that I could not talk to more people in depth. Maybe the goal of the whole thing is not that, is just for people to spend some time together and have fun. Whatever that may mean to them. I enjoyed a lot my little daughter walking in the grass with her nice shoes. She is just about ready to start walking, and it will be so amazing to be a witness of that process. She is so cute… A gift from life. Consciousness unfolding in front of my eyes.\n\nHaving the opportunity of building a family is life changer for me. It brings a lot of different emotions, related to my wife, to the family of her, to my family, etc. Yesterday we had a conversation with her in which I opened my heart and told her that the only thing that I needed from her was truth, her truth, and it was very powerful. Because yes, the only thing that I need from her, and from anyone else, is that they are able to speak their truth. Maybe there is people that are wounded for which it is hard, but I know that it is very healing to speak the truth. It is also an integral part of waking up, because for experiencing truth you have to be truth. There is nowhere to hide. And if you are hiding, it will come up in one way or another, and it will make noise until you take that stone out of your shoe. The amount of energy less that you spend is huge. Imagine a moment when you held your truth inside you. How did it feel? Which were the consequences of it in yourself? And in your surroundings? What if you started to share your truth more often, and with that began to realize how good it feels? The biggest boundary that you build for not doing that is thinking that you won’t be worthy of love because you spoke truth. It couldn’t be more away from reality, because most of the times people end up appreciating you for what you shared of you with them. And if what you share with them is your truth, the truth of who you are, how could that end up having long term consequences?\n\nOpen up to this freedom, and start speaking your truth, as soon as it is clear. You deserve it, and we all deserve it. The world will be a nice place when we all will have space for our own truth, no matter what it is. That is the future of religion, each of us embodying our own truth, and acting from there. The truth is deep within us, it was buried in there because the greatest quest of them all is the one of discovery of your self. And this quest, no one can do it for you. People can help you with pointers, they have been doing it since the dawn of humanity, but no one can walk that path for you. But we can create a community of practice in which we can share the path of discovery, but ultimately only you can walk it. It is you who has to look within and observe what is going on, leaving the deceiving outside, just staring at what is true. That is all that matters. That is the mission for the next years, to use the transformation that humanity is going through as the means to look within. To explore in the depths of our unconscious and the collective unconscious until there is nothing else hiding. Until there is no one looking. Embody yourself so much that you become no one.\n\nIt is time to face my truth. Yesterday when someone asked me what I am doing I answered that I’m creating websites. That is a lie. That is not what I am doing. Why did I speak something different from my truth? What am I hiding? Who am I hiding from? That is a great question, and it is perfect to have witnessed it yesterday. Because it is very hard for me to face that truth, of the difference of what I’m doing from what should be done. But how can I believe in what I’m doing if I’m not able to talk about it? How do I want to bring people about if I won’t tell them from my heart what is being built with my intention? There is a big space for betterment there, and I’m happy to have realized it because it is only by speaking my truth that I will be able to bring it about. It is only by sharing it that people will start to listen. How can people listen if I’m not able to listen myself? My mission is to help in the awakening of humanity, and I’m building a community of practice, gathering people from all over the world that are on that same quest. I’m a magnet that wants to join forces with other seekers, to stop seeking and realize that everything that we were looking for was already here, smiling at our desperate attempts. The seeker needs to give up, and the first step towards that giving up is acknowledging the road that has been travelled until now. Being able to share that with the world, openly, so that people can feel welcomed to join. I don’t like saying that I don’t know something, but now is the perfect time to open up that window and build from there. I only know that I don’t know is the key to success. It is the key to knowing. How can I get some investors for the project if I’m not able to trust in what I’m doing enough to talk about it with someone that cares about me. When is the moment that I start trusting in what I do enough so that I put all my life force in it? That is what I’m doing now, here, by writing down all these words. I’m transforming thoughts and stuff that is going on inside me into something concrete, real, that has an impact because it helps me to better organize everything that is inside. As I write, I process everything. I realize the mistakes that I made, and open up for the possibility of it being different the next time.\n\nWhat will I answer the next time that someones asks me what am I doing now?\n\nWhat I’m doing is the most important work of my existing, realizing the nature of my being. I’m walking that road so that I can pave it for the ones that will come after, and I feel that there will be many of them. I’m Doing The Work, so that I can realize my true nature, and with that be an example, a leader, for all of those that will come afterwards. I’m creating a system, a community of people that are in the same path, so that we can help each other in the process. Im building a network of seekers that want to stop seeking, but can’t because their head is on fire. I’m creating the pond with which this fire will be released, and my sense and feeling is that this pond is built upon lighting the creative spark that each of us has inside. I’m lightning that creative spark for everyone that wants to be there for it. I’m making my way the best I can through the present so that I can be the ones that is building the future. And we are all doing our due diligence in that, we are all creating the future. Every moment at a time, each day, with every action. I’m just becoming more aware of my own actions so that I can evolve the way on which I relate to reality, so that I can enjoy it as much as I can. I’m exploring this maze, finding out how cool it is to be alive right now. I’m creating, every second of my existence, more and more presence. Awareness is making its way through myself, and I’m becoming everything that I have always been. I’m becoming the realization of who I truly am. I’m becoming truth, layer after layer of what is not. I’m becoming all what is, and I’m building from there. I’m connecting with people that care. I’m finding places where those people hang out, and I’m enjoying the ride. I’m being a father, knowing about love through the eyes of the mother of my little girl. I’m learning about love by being in love with life, with every circumstance that presents itself, with every feeling, sensation and emotions.\n\nI’m working on my relationship with my parents, so that I can enjoy them every moment just for who they are. I’m learning how to leave aside the conditioning of wanting them to be different. I’m working on understanding my role in my family, so that I can be gratitude, with everything that they have done for me. I’m working on acknowledging this with all my hear, because all of what I am is a consequence of the effort that they did throughout their life. I acknowledge that I am a consequence of everyone that came before, and I’m learning how to embody that gratitude in every one of my actions.\n\nI’m working on my self. I’m working o making everything that is part of my unconscious conscious, so that I can free up the space in there for truth to come forth. I’m working on becoming truth, on being truth in every second of existence. I’m working on narrowing the focus and what I give energy to, so that I can have a sharper understanding of what life is about and where my energy needs to be put it. I’m working on the pathways that carry life-force inside my whole system, so that I can be as efficient as I can with the movement of it. I’m working on building new neural pathways in my system, so that I can be more present with what is, and less present with what should be. I’m working on trusting my voice, so that I an share it with those who want to listen. I’m working on my breath, to realize that every time it comes into y lungs is a gift that nature has given me to experience. I’m working on making sense, and realizing that there is not too much to make sense of, just a lot to enjoy and be present for. I’m working on a book, which will be the manifesto of the community that I’m building. The place where we will go back to, and remind us how crazy the mind is. I’m working on it so that I can make sense of what is going on, and to realize that it feels good just to be sincere. To talk my truth. To share it freely.\nI’m working on just being me, without preconceptions, without judgements, without shoulds. I’m working on just being. With all of what I am, with all of what I have been.\n\nThat’s what I would answer, that’s what my soul wants to say, but in a moment like yesterday it won’t let it go out because it is not enough. It is never enough. It is never cool enough. It is never interesting enough. I should be earning money. I should be working with more people. I should this, I should that. Those are the stories that are running through the mind as that question comes, and by writing this I make the explicit commitment to be conscious about them, so that I can better realize that hard that I’m making me by not sharing my truth. Both me, and the rest, because all can benefit from my quest of understanding, of my quest of truth. Probably a lot of people won’t listen, it will be just noise, but a lot will, and it will be just what they need in this moments of their life to realize that there is something more than what has been experienced till now.\n\nI’m working on building a system on which all of those will gather. All of those that want to listen. I’m working on developing the means by which I share who I am, refining the message so that it can be better understood. I’m working on bonding humanity, bringing people from all over the world together so that we can truly understand that we are all one. I’m working on developing this true, deep understanding of how we are all the same in the core of our being, and making my best to refine the message to that it can be better spread. I’m working on coming out of the cave on which I have been hiding my whole life. Plato’s cave. I’m working my way out of it, and it feels great out here. There are no boundaries. There are no limits into what can happen from now on.\n\n· · ·\n\nThere is a feeling of lightness as all these realizations come forth, and there seems to be a huge correlation between that and the fact that I’m sitting down to write all these words. It is amazingly powerful. How the unconscious works, and how it can become free from all those bondings that won’t let the ideas flow. I’m working on becoming flow. A force of nature. I’m working on becoming unstoppable. From within. I’m working on sharpening the most important tool that we have as human beings: The Mind. I’m working on refining my understanding of the mind, so that I can share it with people afterwards. I’m working my way towards the understanding that everything that has been in place until now will fall, and that there is no way on which this will be stopped. I’m working my way into the undemanding of my role in this whole process, or more than understanding it, just playing it. I’m working to embody my role in the process by which awareness becomes aware of itself. God realizes itself. The universe realizes itself through me.\n\nI’m working on becoming.\n\nI’m working on just being.\n\nI’m working on love.\n\nI’m working on trust.\n\nI’m working on fearlessness.\n\nI’m working on myself.\n\nI’m working on letting go.\n\nThose are things that are present in this system in this moment, and these words are an exploration into that. Into all that is through me. I am a window into the infinite. I am the infinite. I just don’t know it yet. But it doesn’t matter, there is no rush. Time is just an invention of the mind. Space time is doomed, as a wise men would say. There is nothing such as space time in the absolute reality, it is not true. It is just an aspect of being, of mind, and it is not present in the absolute way.\n\nThere are so many things that I write about that don’t make sense, but I really don’t care, because it doesn’t matter. There won’t be judgments, because they don’t help at all. They give some keys, which I appreciate, but I prefer just doing and realizing what happened.\n\n· · ·\nThat is how the universe evolves, that is how I evolve. In the beginning, if a human ate the poisonous berry, they all would know that it was poisonous because of him. Now, if a person makes 1000 mistakes on twitter, he can share what he has learned and you can learn from him. It gets faster and faster, but the pattern is always the same. There will always be stuff that we have to try and make mistakes and then pass those learnings to the ones that come later, that is just part of how this whole game works, that is just how life is arranged, with this iterative aspect of building itself, making and correcting mistakes all along the way. That is amazing. Life is amazing.\n\nI working on being free of wanting to know it all, and focusing just in the fundamentals. I’m working my way to being a human being, it has been quite a challenge.\n\nThis is me, this is all of who I am, what I am, and this words are being written with the heart. With the willingness to help, but not knowing completely how to do it. With the willingness that just by being I help. With the acknowledgment of all of who I am. That is all that matters.\n\nWho is the one that is sleepy?\n\nWho is the one that is in a rush?\n\nWho is the one that is rough with his father?\n\nWho is the one that judges?\n\nWho is that noise inside the head?\n\nWho is the one that feels lost?\n\nWho is the one that feels insecure?\n\nWho is the one that is impatient with Mila?\n\nAll of those are aspects of that which I’m not. I just haven’t realized it yet, so I feel completely identified with them and experience life as if I am all those aspects. But I’m not.\n\nI am the one that is willing to experience truth.\n\nI am the one that is eager to realize itself.\n\nI am the one that has been looking through this eyes this whole time.\n\nI am the one that laughs.\n\nI am the one that hugs.\n\nI am the one that shows up.\n\nI am the one that Does The Work.\n\nI am the one that is present in the details.\n\nI am the details.\n\nI am.\n\nI am.\n\nI am.\n\nIam.\n\nIm.\n\nOm.\n\nOmmmm….\n\nI am the music.\n\nAll those are aspects of what I can conceptualize as being me. But I’m far beyond those conceptualizations. I am not conceptualizable. I am beyond concepts. I am waiting for you. I have always been.\n\nI am the gratitude.\n\nI am the peace.\n\nI am the being.\n\nI am what is expressed through you.\n\nI am this words, and what is hidden behind them.\n",

But this time, instead of quitting drinking, I proposed myself to not drink for one year. The relationship that I have had with alcohol throughout my life is very deep, and saying goodbye to it in the day of the first birthday of my daughter is something very symbolic. It feels like a new beginning, today coming to the office to do the work in a more disciplined way. I know what I have to do, but the mind always puts its noise in between and I end up being disorganized. But being disciplined is the means by which I establish the boundaries on which my sadhana will be developed, on which I will be able to use the foundations that I have built for my life until now to create something big from there. It is time for me to create, and the most profound way on which I will be able to do it is by being rigorous with the stuff that I do and how I do it, so that I can create from there. From the place of showing up. The first 5 days of writing here were absolutely powerful, but then came a dip on which stuff in my life started happening, and I was not able to keep it up. I was not able to show up for myself, and come and write what I had to write. It is not that I have to write something specific, it is just that I have to come here and show up to be a witness of what is channeled through me. I just write whatever comes, there is not a clear understanding of the process, it just happens. But for it to happen, I need to take some time to sit down and actually do it. Enter the state of being on which stuff can come. And in the last days I was nt able to do it, but today is a new beginning. I realized that it is very important, both for me and for my family, to give clear messages about what I\\u2019m going to d. Not the specifics, but at least the timings on which I will do my work. So today I started with that, and it feels great. I feel much more complete, because I feel that I\\u2019m taking care of myself. By showing up to do the work, I take care of myself. I have done a lot of internal work, a lot of stuff to feel better, to heal, but the most important one is the one that is done daily. The sadhana. And my sadhana includes as a big part coming here to do the work. May it be programming, writing, or whatever, but I need to do it to feel good with myself. To bring about what needs to be brought about. And when I don\\u2019t do it, I feel like a failure, I feel that there is something that is not in place. SO I better continue as today, doing it, so that the important stuff can come forth. It is only by this that I will be able to bring into my life what I want to bring. It is only by being committed to what I want to do that I will be able to shine.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:`And you came here, because there is something that resonates with you in this message. There is something deep within you that is calling for something new, for something different, and I\\u2019m here right now writing these words for you to know that I\\u2019m here for you. All of what I have been, all of what I am, and all of what I have been is here for you. I won\\u2019t tell you the clich\\xE9s of love yourself, you are everything, bla bla blah, because that is the easy part. Knowing it conceptually is the easy part, and the hard one (and most important) is to actually embody all that wisdom. And the only way on which you will be able to embody that wisdom is by showing up to Do The Work. Whatever shape and size it may have for you. But show up, consistently. Consistency is the mother of all the tools that can bring you to success, and you don\\u2019t need anything else than that commitment with yourself to see results. You are still young to take that risk. There will always be an opportunity to take the risk of becoming more of who you are. And it is the risk with the higher payment upside that you will find in life. There is no more important work to be done in the earth than discovering the truth of who you are. And for that you\\u2019ve got to show up. You have to be on the trenches, and get to know yourself. And the only way on which you will know yourself is by doing the work, because there is where your deepest biases will come up. The samskaras, as we would say in a different languages. All of those are information that is present in our system, and that shows up when we are able to face the discomfort. Each time that you have fear and you end up facing it and you discover that it was not that terrible you will grow your understanding of yourself and the limits of what you can do. And that is an upward spiral, which will bring you more and more of thet understanding the more you walk that road. The more you show up for yourself. Having in mind the power of what can happen, and always giving you the opportunity to reflect on what happened in the process. Life teaches this way, and you are never too young of too old to realize it.\nThis whole writing piece, this whole Manifesto, as I have called it, is a quest into the understanding of what Dukkha is about, what it will bring into the world. The more I think about it the less clear it is, so the way on which it will happen is by just bringing it into being by being it. To embody everything that is behind the motivation for the project. And that is what I have been doing this whole time, just making my way through the wilderness and finding the means and tools to walk towards the truth. It is all about the truth. The open truth. It is a way of gathering community around this quest, and for us to realize collectively the ways of which that quest is transforming our lives. Because there is an importance of going to a retreat to get a glimpse of what all this thing is, but there needs to be a way on which to bring that about into the everyday life, and that is what matters. At the end of the day, the daily life is what constitutes all of who we become, and if we go to a retreat to end up missing being in the retreat, we end up being deceived from the message that was wanting to be conveyed in it. And the tools for living in the moment are hard to grasp. It has been hard (until now) to live from creative work only, but that is changing. And because of this, the more connected you are from the source, the better you will be at doing this kind of work. The clearer it will be. So my answer to the whole question is building Dukkha, a community of practice that will be about showing up. To Do The Work. And the 21 day intensives are steps towards furthering that commitment, by digging a little bit deeper into the life story of the people that will be part of that journey. So this project is about giving people a frame on which they can rely to Do The Work, a community of practice, and also to build those transformational journeys for them to deepen their capacity to do it. Something like a deep attunement. But all of this are the aspects that will bring about the project, and they are based on my own experience, on what I have found helpful, and on what I want to help people avoid. I am realizing more and more that the ones that need to wake up first are the 18 year olds that are a bit lost, depressed, and unhappy with how the world is looking right now. They feel that there is something different, but in that feeling there is a lack of something that can anchor it to their life.`}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"I can relate a lot of my life story to this also, because there is a constant feeling inside me that tells me that a big part of my life was wasted by being in a place that I did not want to be, doing stuff that I didn\\u2019t resonate with. I had a lot of fun, obviously, but that fun doesn\\u2019t have any level of comparison with what is going on right now. There is no universe on which it can be compared. It shouldn\\u2019t be compared. But what I imagine your life having at least 3 months of Doing The Work before going to college so that you can realize if you want to focus on that for the rest of your life (expressing who you are through the creative act and refining the connection that you have with yourself).\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"I wrote that and it doesn\\u2019t feel appropriate.

And from there you can make choices, if you want to do creative work, go to college, whatever you decide to do, but may it be from a place of truth. That is the way forward, and that is the mission of Dukkha, to help this young children in that quest. Are they too young for going into this rabbit hole? Maybe, but the thing related to the way stuff was done in the past is that before you had to go to a specific place to practice, and there was a lot of judgement that came from the outside and that could have put in place a lot of fear. Right now, I\\u2019m sure that the communities of practice are going to be held mostly online, and that brings about a whole realm of opportunities related to Doing The Work. You don\\u2019t have to care if you are the coolest kid in the school and meditating is \\u2018nerd\\u2019, you can just create an Anon character in the internet and show up. That is all that is needed. No one needs to know what you are doing, because you are just doing it for yourself. Not for anyone else. No one can tell if you are actually doing the work, because it is such a personal thing.

Maybe in 5 years we will have a computer program that will be the ultimate truth seeker, and it will be something like The Infinite Jest. In that book, there was a movie that was so entertaining that if you started watching it you could not stop, so you would end up dying. What if that dying actually refers to waking up? What if The Infinite Jest is a film that is so powerful that it has the effect of waking up to your own nature?

The idea is to always have reflections about what happened, and with them, realize what works and what doesn\\u2019t so that we can make all progress together, as a community. The mission is to awaken the world, and there is no place as the internet to build a community of practice.

No one can Do The Work for you, but if you start soon, you will already be traveling the road a few months ahead.

Maybe there is people that are wounded for which it is hard, but I know that it is very healing to speak the truth. It is also an integral part of waking up, because for experiencing truth you have to be truth. There is nowhere to hide.

          "raw": "\nDay 11, 06 October 2022\nThe perpetual seeker. Those are the words that came as a description of who I have been. Diving into all the experiences that I have found in order to ‘heal’, so that eventually I can become more anchored in the present. In presence. That is the main goal that has been revealed throughout this whole journey, of pure, uninterrupted presence. I have tried to be intelligent my whole life, and that is the ultimate intelligence. I have tried to enjoy my whole life, and the key is to stop trying and just enjoy. I have tried to express myself throughout my whole life, and the clearest way to do it, the most pure and sincere, is to just share who I am from that which arises from presence. From being presence.\n\nYesterday I had an important experienced, on which I shared something with a group of people and then spent quite a bunch of time digesting what had been shared, because it didn’t feel real, it didn’t resonate with my voice. So then I went back and shared from a place of more clarity, of more presence, and what came out of it was just poetry. It was one of those pieces to which I come back moment after moment to just read it again. Obviously there is an aspect to be a witness to the reaction that people had to it, but it was not the main thing. The main thing was to realize that that is my voice. That is who I am when the boundaries of the mind are not in the middle, and when there are no boundaries at all. That is who I want to be, because it is a pure expression of who I am. Writing helps me express who I am through words, and there are times on which they just flow out and there is no interruption from the mind on that process. There seems to be a direct pathway between my Self and what is being written. Sometimes the mind gets in between, but when it doesn’t, it feels great. It feels sincere. And I know that people get that, I have gotten a lot of feedback related to it. All what I’m doing with these words here is to explore a little bit deeper into what comes when I let that flow free. I don’t seem to have a clear direction, I’m not sure about what I’m doing here, but it feels like the right thing to do. There is a constant pressure on the top of my shoulders related to making money and bringing that material comfort to my family, but there really isn’t clarity on how to do that. I feel completely lost in that realm. And I need help. I really need help. And who will know that I need help if I don’t raise my hand and ask for it?\n\nIt is time to go for that, and everything that I will write down here is an exploration into that.\n\n---\n\nWhat do I want to accomplish?\n\nI want to transform all the spiritual growth that I have gone through into material growth, by healing the relationship that I have with money and with myself in the process. There is always imposter syndrome present, which won’t let me progress in a way that is professional. Everything I do lacks a component of quality because I’m all over the place. I jump from here to there, and that is always bringing me down because there is no consistency, there is no truth in the sense that what I bring into the world is disalligned with what I have inside, because there is always a rush into doing stuff. There is not this aspect of polishing, of sanding, of putting consciousness into what I do.\n\nAll those things are coming from the negative, from bringing about the bad things, what is missing. What is lacking. Why don’t better bring up the positive? I have done a lot of personal work, which has led me to be very responsible for myself. I have a strong voice and a lot of things to say, and I want to be able to create something with which I can help people walk that same road. I have been paving the road for people to walk it with less effort, with less struggle, because I know that not all of people have the same drive and passion that I have. And it doesn’t need to be like that, we are all different, but I want to be able to help other people walk that road of self discovery. Of understanding who they are, where their thoughts are coming from, so that they can be not identified by them. I know that the consequence of this is a cleaner expression of creativity, and I want to help people tap into their creative potential. I want to find the ones that want to walk the road that I have paved with my experience, and I want to clarify what that road looks like by realizing it with these people. I want to refine my message so that it can better resonate with that people. I want to learn how to polish, sand and clarify what I write so that it has a bigger impact in the people that will read. I want to build a system for my writing, so that I can focus completely in the person that will read it.\n\nThere has been people that have benefited enormously from what I have written, and I want to find those so that I can make an impact in their life. I want to reach out, communicate and enjoy life from there. I want to learn who I am by interacting with people. The concept networking has always made noise in my head, because I have always looked at it from an utilitaristic sense. It was always a means to an end, talking to people because I want to make business with them. But I was lacking in that realization was the transformative aspect of business. We make business because it is the way on which we bring who we are into the world, and if I’m able to tap into that and realize that it is very helpful for those who are involved, I will walk towards becoming free of this money issue if I’m able to realize that money is the means by which we exchange information in society, about preferences, about who we want to be. I want to build a system around myself that cares about that. That cares about the movement of energy that is produced by people spending their life force in something who they want to become. There is the sentence in my mind going on: People like us do things like this. That is the thing. People like us spend money on things like this. On what have I spent the most money in the last years of my life? Self improvement. There is no end to it, it is addictive, and I don’t think I’ll stop because there is so much to learn, and so many people to learn from. It is a spiral, and the people that I have met in that spiral are the people with which I want to share my life. It is easy for me to forget about it and feel that I’m alone, think that I’m alone, but it is not like that. I’m not alone. There is a lot of people that care about me, that care about what I do, and if I’m not able to realize that fact I won’t get anywhere. I can list all the adventures that come to my mind related to self improvement, and think about all the people that were in those experiences:\n\n- Universo Paralello\n- Permaculture course in el manzano\n- Vipassana\n- Traveling around the world to discover myself\n- Yoga teacher training course\n- Innovation Masters\n- Creatives Workshop, and all the akimbo ones\n- altMBA\n- Gathering for the families\n- IAM retreat, samadhi center\n- Breathwork therapy with Rocio\n- Breathwork training with Rocio\n\nAll of these experiences are deep inside me, and define who I am. The people that are part of those experiences are the ones that care about me, and the ones that know me in the deepest level. A lot of the people inside those places know me, and care about me. Probably they would be delighter to hear my voice, to read it, and realize who I have become. If I’m not sharing it with them, if I’m still hiding, I won’t be able to walk towards where I have to walk. It is time for me to realize where my strength is, and it is related to being able to see other people. To care about them. My strengths are always related to the relationship that I can build with other people, because I’m very good at that. I’m very good at realizing what someone needs, and pointing that person towards that so that there can be some kind of resolution.\n\nWhat I want to accomplish is to have a group of people that care about what I write, and to develop a relationship with them that makes me feel alive. I want to go out of my hiding, and share who I am with the world. I want to help people, and be able to value that help so that I can live from that. So that I can provide my family. I want to build a tribe around what I’m spreading into the world, which is a constant willingness to get the most out of life. To live experiences as deeply as I can, and learn from there. I love going into courses, learning about different stuff, and it is time for me to embrace that and create from there. Become a creator of the world that I want to live in by sharing with people the importance of constant evolution. It is not about a particular subject, a particular thing that you do. It is not about going into A or B course, workshop, or whatever. It is about having learners mindset all the time, and this is the moment on which I realize that. It is the moment on which I discover that what I came to do here is to learn from other people, and explore who I am in that whole process. I will be a node in the eternal seeking of knowledge, of inspiration, of growth. I will be the one that builds the course that other people will come in and be very very very inspired by. I will be the connector, the one that builds stuff. The builder. I’m jp, the builder of experiences. For example, in this cohort, each of us is paying 500 bucks to learn more about twitter in community. There will be a point on which all of us will be the eternal learner, and that is the mindset that I want to bring into the world. Not one of awakening particularly, not one of A or B, just one of beginners mindset. Of realizing that each thing that you do can be an exploration into who you can become, by facing the challenge of learning something now.\n\nThere may be some people for which it is hard to come in a place and be alone in there, without anyone that they know from before, but I’m way past that. I don’t care about it. I just show up, with everything that I am. And I guess that that is a reason because of which people don’t show up in online stuff, because they prefer going to a place that they know since before. It is not an easy thing to show up in front of people that you don’t know, but because of that they are losing a lot. It is very important to face that fear, and just show up. Be a witness of everything that comes up after that experience. Always being a witness of how you react to different circumstances, and if those circumstances are varied, it will be very cool.\n\nI don’t think I’ll have a specific audience, because what I care about changes every day. I can’t help it. I just roll with it. Should I focus more? I don’t think I could. It is a huge part of the way on which I relate to life to be jumping from one thing to the next one. I just can’t help it. It is all part of who I am. So probably I will end up crafting journeys for people to dive in and enjoy, the same as the one that I just started, Create, Publish, Profit. In it, they have gathered a bunch of creators that teach you how to become like them, each of them giving their example, each of them showing how they have walked the road. In this case that road is the one of Twitter, they share who they have become in Twitter. But what if in my case I share that road in life? Who is the person that I have become because of everything that I have done? How can I enroll people into that journey so that they can be transformed by just experiencing it? That is the journey that I’m in, the one of discovering the answer of how I share myself with the world so that I can have a better grasp to what brings value to them. What is the value that I bring into the world? How can I share more of that?\n\nIsn’t the answer clear? By just sharing myself. By just being who I am. With that, I can eliminate all the friction that is in the middle of who I should be, of who I could be. I am just who I am in that moment, and that is all that matters so that the impact can be made. From myself to the outside. Bringing to the world what I care about. I spend so much time creating a ‘breathwork persona’ on the internet and it doesn’t even matter, because the amount of people that I will work with in that realm is much less than what will eventually follow what I do. I just need to refine my message so that I understand how to share it more clearly. That is the game. It is not about building personas around a particular thing, it is just about sharing my voice in the clearest way I can, and that is by writing. I know that my thing is writing. I know that I become who I am by writing, and I know that I care about people that write and read. I don’t feel comfortable around those that are not able to pick up a book and read it, because there is something that is missing from that interaction for me. It is the wonder, the willingness to grow, the willingness to become a different version. And that willingness opens up when you have the courage to open a book, or an article, or whatever written piece, and be open to change because of it. That is the people that I want to relate to, and if I don’t write I will never be able to tap into those communities. I just need to show up and share my thoughts, letting the mind not filter them with its noise, but letting it become an empty vessel from which stuff can arise.\n\nBeing creative means to let arise the genius from within. Opening up space for that to happen. If I’m always trying to control, always trying to find the way out, I’ll never make it. There will always be that noise running on the background telling me that I could be doing things differently. In meditation, we free up space for the self to shine through the noise. That process can be related to the one of creativity arising, on which I free up the space for me to be who I am, through my creative act. I open up that space and I set it free. I let it be. That’s all that matters, the set and setting so that it can shine through. And that is what all the work I have done is about, creating the means for that to happen. The most important spiritual act is done in every moment, as you get up from the cushion and live life from the understanding of what was brought up during the practice: that all there is is change.\n\nThat’s all what the practice is about. It is creating conditions for better understanding of the underlying principles of how you interact with the world. It is about the eternal discovery of who you are, in every moment. That’s what Socrates meant with ‘all I know is that I don’t know’. There is absolute zero certainty about how life will look like in a moment different from the present, and that is the game that you have to learn to play. Everything that truly is is what you are experiencing now. It’s all that you’ll ever have. That is the beauty of it, because there hasn’t been a moment different than the present in all the history of humanity. Each human that has ever been alive has had the window into the wonders of life in each moment, no matter what was going on in his surroundings. That’s why it is the highest form of intelligence, because it is not related to who you have been, or what you actually know. It is about how able you are to make decisions based on what is going on in front of you, right now. It is about realizing that every reality is built from what happens in this moment, and I want to be able to share that with the world.\n\nI want to dive deep into everything that is going in the internet, and realize that there can be enormous wealth that can come from there. Not because of a specific end, but because it is a window into presence. Into exploring who we are by going out of our confort zone. I want to be an example of that. I want to throw myself into the void constantly, just by experiencing what it looks like to have someone fully engaged in what is going on in there. The future of us looks like cohorts around stuff, and the important thing is to realize than in each and every one of them there is value, because each of those are unique with the people that are in there. When you have a particular mixture of people, no matter who they are, there will always be growing in there. I can go into a pottery class and give my best in it, and there will always be something that I will learn that will transform who I am in the process and help me progress towards that deeper understanding. It is about lowering the barriers, and letting yourself just be by throwing you into the void. That is the important thing, throwing yourself into the void. Creating stuff. It is about having the coolest creators in the world, and being able to be right there, next to them, Doing The Work. Evolving together by showing up to the craft.\n\nA great idea is unravelling as I go through this rant, because it is an amazing concept. Grab a great product designer, and put him into a cohort of people that for 21 days Do The Work 4 hours every day. They have to show up and create. And they are all perfecting the craft, and becoming more of what they can be just by doing the thing. It doesn’t matter what it is, the person will know, but it will be an important thing because of what will show up in the process. Musicians, artists, whoever you want. It is just about showing up to do the work. No more learning on a vacuum, just show up and work alongside each of the persons that are in there. And if you have any questions, just share them with the people. Someone will know the answer. Or you can work your way through. This is the perfect antidote for procrastination, because it is about showing up, each day, to become who you want to become. Do put in the repetitions. To share. To share who you are, and where you are at. It is not about comparing A to B and realizing that one is better and the other one is not, that doesn’t work anymore. It is about lighting that spark that can make you shine for your own accounts, it doesn’t matter who is next to you. You have a specific combination of knowledge, expertise and life experience that is deeply embedded in your unconscious, and if you are able to realize that the highest form on which you can create from there is to erase your mind from the process and just Do The Work, you will thrive. This is where all your being comes into form, when you are able to create from a place of trust. Of openness. Of just showing up. Each person in the world is in a different level, each person in the world has something different to offer. Just show up, and give your best. Only you know what your best looks like.\n\nWhat are my dreams and aspirations?\n\nI want to become more of myself. I want to make peace with the noise in my head and truly internalize how helpful it has been throughout my life, but move on from there. I want to be able to be part of cohorts all my life, and be learning every day something new. I want to be able to convey what I have learned in a way that makes sense for those who will listen, and I want to help people realize that taking chances and risks is the way forward into a life of presence. I want to help people to realize that they already have everything that they need, because everything that they need is their presence. It is all of what they have. I aspire to be able to accept me for who I am, and accept people that surround me. I aspire to be able to embrace the fact that my parents have done their best, in spite of what I can think that they did wrong. I want to have a voice that is heard, and aligned with the deepest core of my being. I want to have a consistent practice that lets me live from that, and give love to my daughter in the process. I want to have time to teach her the beauty of life, and not be trapped in the system. I want to teach myself in a different way from what I was taught, so that I can help build a new way of education.\n\nWhat are my biggest fears?\n\nAsking for help, and realizing that I’m not enough. The biggest fear that I’m facing right now is the dissolution of who I think I am. It is the discovery of what I truly am, and there is no fear as the one that I have experienced when I sit down and meditate. It is an animal thing. Another fear that comes to my mind is my father dying and I not been able to be there with him without complaining for everything that he does. I fear not to free myself from that burden before he dies. I fear that I can’t be the child that he needs before he dies. But what is that? I’m just what I am, and that is everything that he needs. Probably he doesn’t have all these thoughts in his mind, for him, I am just who I am. It is me the one that wants to change his relationship with him, so that I can appreciate more everything that he has done. But I’m appreciating it. I and doing my work. I am here helping as much as I can given the circumstances that I have been giving in my life. I am, truly, giving my best. A big fear is not being able to make it and having to get a 9-5 job.\n\nWhat obstacles am I facing?\n\nLack of clarity. There is always too much noise in my mind related to not doing the correct thing. The last year I spent it learning how to code to then realize that I did not want to do that as a proper job, and there is a huge feeling inside me that I wasted a lot of time that I could have spent writing, or doing something different. A big obstacle is that it is never enough for me. I’m looking for something else all the time, and this takes energy from my missions because those missions change very often. I have a strong feeling that I have been iterating and moving closer towards something, but when is it really going to end?\n\nA huge obstacle is that I don’t have a source of income right now. This brings a lot of pressure into what I do, because I need to start earning money so that I can provide to my family and live with that. I don’t need to much, so it is kind of ridiculous to be in this position, but it is what it is. I don’t truly know what to do to earn money from the position that I am and continue to do what I want to do, but I know that I have to start somewhere. A big obstacle is the noise in my head that tells me that I could be doing something different, more productive.\n\nWhat problem do I solve? The suffering. The identification with the suffering that people go through in life, and that is a consequence of not being clear about what they want. Not be willing to take risks and build the life that they can be proud of. The identification with their thoughts. You are not your thoughts, you are way beyond that, and you spend most of your time thinking about them.\n\nI help them connect with their self so that their true creative work can come out of there.\n\nWhat will they achieve? Clarity in the way that they relate to themselves, and because of that, with their surroundings.\n\nWhat can I promise them? My presence and holding space for their transformation. I don’t have the answers, I can’t have them, they are just inside them.\n\n—\n\nI want to be there for people and help them become who they can become.\n",

There is a constant pressure on the top of my shoulders related to making money and bringing that material comfort to my family, but there really isn\\u2019t clarity on how to do that.

I know that the consequence of this is a cleaner expression of creativity, and I want to help people tap into their creative potential. I want to find the ones that want to walk the road that I have paved with my experience, and I want to clarify what that road looks like by realizing it with these people. I want to refine my message so that it can better resonate with that people. I want to learn how to polish, sand and clarify what I write so that it has a bigger impact in the people that will read.

It is not an easy thing to show up in front of people that you don\\u2019t know, but because of that they are losing a lot. It is very important to face that fear, and just show up.

          "raw": "\nClarity is the consequence of regularly showing up to Do The Work. If you don’t show up, your unconscious doesn’t have food for digesting when you are Doing The Rest. It’s impossible that something can pop up magically there because there is nowhere from. So show up and Do The Work. It is everything you need to get to where you want to get.\n\nYesterday was a that brought a lot of clarity into my being, and just by listening to Ryan Breslow talk. He brought to me a better understanding of what I’m doing, and why I’m doing it, and with that I was able to make some good progress. Mainly in the way that I structure my time in the day, and the things that I give energy to. I was too focused on just writing writing and origin, but not focused on building what I want to build, so there was not clarity actually related to what I am building. There was a kind of big blur in front of my eyes related to how to progress, but now that is a little bit more gone and it is clearer that what I need to do is help in the Love DAO, build Dukkha DAO, work on the Create, Pubish, Profit course, and in there, work in the creation of the community around Dukkha. That is the interesting part of this thing. I wanted a roadmap on how to build a DAO, but there is actually none that can fit that because each thing is different. The most important aspect of it is the community, and yesterday this clarity came from the understanding that the community’s first approach will be built on Twitter. That’s why I am in this course, to learn how to use Twitter and grow an audience there, because that audience is actually the people that afterwards will be part of the DAO. That is the key aspect of this whole thing that I was missing. And related to Love DAO, I support everything that they are doing, and I want to help consistently to see what is going on in there. That is the mission at least for the next month: Build Dukkha, help in Love DAO with whatever I can, and go through CPP with all the energy that I can.\n\nI spent a big chunk of the day yesterday feeling kind of disappointed with my decision of having gone away from the TMS to change it for a program that focuses on Twitter, which someway feels more shallow, but now it makes sense. I had forgotten why I am there. I had forgotten what I was aiming to build. I forgot my mission, and it is time to take it back. There is something important that I’m doing here, and it is time to bring up the clarity that will make it happen. And as I wrote at the beginning, clarity is just a consequence of showing up to do the work. It is a consequence of caring enough to do something that has not been done, with the intention of just expressing what is inside. That is my goal here, that is my mission. It is just to bring about this thing that I’m feeling inside, and it is important to clarify what that thing is so that I can move on with it, full power. Right now I have not been able to do it, and it sucks, but it is also part of the process. This blur that has gone through my mind is normal in this process. I acknowledge it, and it will come back. That’s why it is important to have in mind what the purpose of what is being done, and more than that, establish the foundations of how it will be done, so that I can show up and Do The Work even if I don’t really know why am I doing it. There is not a clear understanding of it, and it is OK like that. It is part of the process of working from the unconscious also, because when the clarity isn’t there, the background is still aiming towards that. There is still a direction that is given by something beyond my thinking mind. So the important thing, as I said, is to build these systems that can make things happen automatically.\n\nThat is part of what I bring into the table. The capacity for showing up. The caring for doing the work. The consistency. I don’t have any problem for being consistent, but the thing is that until now I haven’t been able to monetize that capacity so I feel always this cloud on the top of my head that tells me that I need money to survive. And I do need it, so I need to find a way on which to monetize what I have grown to be, to share it with the world. I think that this accountability of being consistent is a big part of the game, because it is what actually transforms you. It is what brings about all the elements that you need to make progress. It is what ends up having the consequences that you don’t know it has. Just show up and let yourself be transformed by what comes.\n\nGoing through this different states of mind has been hard, especially because right now I am in a direct need of earning money. I need to pay my bills, but it is part of the game what is going on. I realize that there is something away from the optimal of how it could be, and I live with that, because it is going to be relieved soon. I know it. I know that there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I know that the transformation that I’m going through is very deep. What is happening in me is fundamental in every level, and I need to give myself the space and time for experimenting complately. If I have to ask my family for money to survive, so be it, it is part of what needs to be done in this moment. I don’t feel bad about it, I have done it enough to know that it is part of the game. But I also need to go through this struggle, to feel it. To realize what it is like to not have money to feed your family. To be willing to sell your stuff so that you can pay the credit cards. It is the game that I’m playing right now, in this year, and I acknowledge it and live with it. It is all part of what I need to experience. But it is also time for me to do something so that I can provide my wife with what she needs to start feeling good about this whole thing. I know that I have been more and more providing on the emotional level, but it is time to ground that and bring it in a material one also. And it is also time for me to share with the world who I am, and what I’m capable of. And that will happen only by opening up the possibility of coaching other people in what I’m good at. Being consistent, meditating, and building up new habits that transform your life. Going from an unconscious human being to a conscious one, and giving everything of who you are in the process. That is how this game is played, and I need to start creating my stuff so that I can build from there. So what time am I going to give me to do that? Which is the moment of the day on which I build my personal brand? I need to start developing a coaching program that will let me reach out and help people, and get some feedback soon. That is the way on which I’ll be able to grow, because I need to start trusting more and more in what I have to offer. I have the first person that I’ll work with, Nancy, and I’m sure that she trusts me enough to go into this process with me. I’m sure that I will help her a lot. I’m sure that I can hold the space for her transformation. She is ready for it, she has talked to me about it and it is time. It is time to bring about what I will share with the world and materialize it. It is time to start Doing The Work, in every realm. I can do different things, I’m able to, and it is time to just do it. To be focused and just do it. Prioritize and give my energy to what is important, as AoP says, to what brings up a biggest ROI. What am I investing my energy in, and which is the intention behind that? Who am I networking with? That is always a hard one. Networking. But I haven’t done it enough, with intention, and yesterday there was a big message that it is something that I should do more. A psychedelic integration coach told me that he really likes my tweets. That means that he likes what I’m spreading, the voice I have, and I’m opening up to the world in that way. There is also this guy called Dimitri who always likes what I write. Those are the people that I want to relate with. Those are the ones that care about what I’m speaking, and those are the ones that will be in the 1% of the fans of what I produce. It is time to Do The Work, and the best work that I do in my life is relating to people. That is my gift. And what comes from there is the building of community, of authentic relationships based on vulnerability, trust and caring for each other. That is what I bring into the game, because that is all of who I am. I have been peeling the layers of the onion until I have reached the point where I am at now, and this point feels full of wonder, of vulnerability, of wanting to dive deeper into the understanding of other human beings. We are all in this together, that is the whole beauty of the thing. That is what is brought into my self with the prospect of building a community, and it is time for me to realize that and embrace it. Build my tribe from there. I will continue in this road as much as it is needed, because it is my calling. It is what came here to do. Help people show up. Hold space.\n\nI have Done The Work myself so that I can share what I have learned with others. I have been there on the trenches, Doing it, and it is time for me to share what I have learned. I know that there is value on who I am, on what I’m doing, and I know that I’m where humanity is growing, because there will be an explosion of spirituality in the metaverse. I know that. It is the promise of the mathrymandir but in the digital realm, so that we can hide behind a mask and just Do The Work without anyone really caring about it. Just for yourself. Just for who you are. That is the promise of our age, and that is what I have signed up for by doing what I have done. There is questionings, and fears, and all that stuff, but it will eventually stay behind because what I’m doing here is way bigger than myself. It is way more important. It is the ultimate integration, where all religions come together to be experienced as one.\n\nThe last episode of Lex Fridman with Samana Harris is just a jewel, and I need to give myself time to sit down and watch it completely. The conceptualization of the self and the relationship of it with the body is something that is very aligned with what I have been studying and experiencing in other realms, and it is just amazing how all this thing is rooted in our biology and the way on which we relate to the world. I’m very eager to better understand the scientific explanations of everything that is going on here, and to grow from that understanding into a person that is better equipped to talk about this whole thing. It will be huge, to talk to people that are more scientific, and give them the whole background of what is going on. There is something deep happening here, something that is fundamentally changing, and it is time. This is the moment in history on which it will happen, we will wake up and realize that we are deeply rooted to the fabric of reality. It is time to experience life from there, from that perspective, and I’m sure that the intersection between science and spirituality is the pathless path. That is the way forward. Meditation and self inquiry, looking deeply into what is, and embracing. Growing from it. Evolving from it. Who know what will come after this whole thing, but I truly know that in that intersection there is the information that is needed to make the progress that I want to make. And this people are already doing that. It is happening, in every realm. It is just time to open up the eyes and reach out, raise the hand and ask for help. That is what I’m good at, talking to people, leading. That is what I came here for. To lead. To create a view of the world, show it to people, and explore it together. I’m paving the road into a new way of understanding, into a new way of experiencing life, and if I don’t light the candle no one will walk that road. It is time to walk it together. It is time to shine.\n\nAll the information is in the table, and what is just needed today is to sit down and Do The Work. That is everything. Just sit. No more rational understanding of the thing, no more trying to escape the mind with the mind. Just let go.\n\n—\n\nIdeas are blurry, stuff is blurry. I’m inspired by something, and then I go out and start thinking that the future of what I should do is AI research and development. Then I go back and start thinking about another thing. What I truly need is the means by which offer my coaching services and have at least one client every day. That is all what I need, one client every week day, two hours per day of complete focus on her, and that can bring to my life the economic peace that I need to pursue everything else that I want to pursue, without caring about that aspect. But that is the noise again speaking, the fear, the lack of trust.\n\nWhere does this lack of trust come from? What is it about? Is it going anywhere? Of course not. But there needs to be some movement, my spirit is growing inside me, but the means by which it is expressed not yet. Which is going to be the means by which it is expressed? By helping people. By showing up for them. That is everything I need, just show up for people in a consistent way. Be there for them.\n\nI’m really struggling with this thing, realizing how to move forward so that I can have my first client. What is the program that I’m building about? Who are the ones that I want to help? Who are the ones that I want to show up for?\n\nI’m training myself to be a breathwork facilitator, to be there for the process of other human beings.\n\nHoly shit, this thing is a maze. I’m a maze. Just start moving.\n\nI feel completely lost right now, but I did my thing. It is weird for me to network by force. I don’t feel good by doing it. It doesn’t seem to be my thing. My thing is just holding space, but not talking for the sake of it.\n\nI’m quite desperate now, because I need to earn some money. All the time the money thing revolving my mind. I need to make peace with that fact. I don’t even want to see my credit card balance, and face the fact that I’m nowhere with this thing. I feel like melting, not knowing how to make progress. Not knowing how to generate what is needed to move forward. I don’t have an audience, I don’t have people with which I feel comfortable sharing this feelings, and I don’t know how to make progress. What am I going to do? I just close my eyes and wait for a miracle to happen, for something to show up. But I don’t know what that can be.\n\nThis is an amazing moment to ask: Who is the one that feels anxious? Who is the one that is going through all this shit?\n",

Mainly in the way that I structure my time in the day, and the things that I give energy to. I was too focused on just writing writing and origin, but not focused on building what I want to build, so there was not clarity actually related to what I am building. There was a kind of big blur in front of my eyes related to how to progress, but now that is a little bit more gone and it is clearer that what I need to do is help in the Love DAO, build Dukkha DAO, work on the Create, Pubish, Profit course, and in there, work in the creation of the community around Dukkha. That is the interesting part of this thing. I wanted a roadmap on how to build a DAO, but there is actually none that can fit that because each thing is different. The most important aspect of it is the community, and yesterday this clarity came from the understanding that the community\\u2019s first approach will be built on Twitter. That\\u2019s why I am in this course, to learn how to use Twitter and grow an audience there, because that audience is actually the people that afterwards will be part of the DAO. That is the key aspect of this whole thing that I was missing. And related to Love DAO, I support everything that they are doing, and I want to help consistently to see what is going on in there.

There is something important that I\\u2019m doing here, and it is time to bring up the clarity that will make it happen. And as I wrote at the beginning, clarity is just a consequence of showing up to do the work. It is a consequence of caring enough to do something that has not been done, with the intention of just expressing what is inside. That is my goal here, that is my mission. It is just to bring about this thing that I\\u2019m feeling inside, and it is important to clarify what that thing is so that I can move on with it, full power. Right now I have not been able to do it, and it sucks, but it is also part of the process. This blur that has gone through my mind is normal in this process. I acknowledge it, and it will come back. That\\u2019s why it is important to have in mind what the purpose of what is being done, and more than that, establish the foundations of how it will be done, so that I can show up and Do The Work even if I don\\u2019t really know why am I doing it. There is not a clear understanding of it, and it is OK like that. It is part of the process of working from the unconscious also, because when the clarity isn\\u2019t there, the background is still aiming towards that.

And I do need it, so I need to find a way on which to monetize what I have grown to be, to share it with the world. I think that this accountability of being consistent is a big part of the game, because it is what actually transforms you. It is what brings about all the elements that you need to make progress. It is what ends up having the consequences that you don\\u2019t know it has.

I know that there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I know that the transformation that I\\u2019m going through is very deep. What is happening in me is fundamental in every level, and I need to give myself the space and time for experimenting complately. If I have to ask my family for money to survive, so be it, it is part of what needs to be done in this moment. I don\\u2019t feel bad about it, I have done it enough to know that it is part of the game. But I also need to go through this struggle, to feel it. To realize what it is like to not have money to feed your family. To be willing to sell your stuff so that you can pay the credit cards. It is the game that I\\u2019m playing right now, in this year, and I acknowledge it and live with it. It is all part of what I need to experience. But it is also time for me to do something so that I can provide my wife with what she needs to start feeling good about this whole thing.

          "raw": "\nDukkha is the great reset.\n\nPeople talk about the great reset in the economy, and how things are going to change after the recession that will come in the next years. Yeah, probably there will be something deep going on in that sense, but I think that the biggest reset will be related to how we relate to our own existence as human beings. There needs to be a fundamental change in the way on which we experience life, and that is what Dukkha is about. About going deep into the understanding of how to change. On what to change.\n\nAnd you will be alone in it.\n\nYes, we will build a community of supportive people around this process, which will help you as much as we can so that you can make sense of all what will happen, but at the end of the day, you will be alone. No one is going to go through your shit for you, it is the game that you will sign up as you accept to be part of one of this transformational journeys. You will have to go though it alone, and you’ll have to pay with all of what you think you are. You have to be willing to be transformed, because this process will transform you. You will become a different person after this, and that is what the great reset is about. It is not about the economy, or this, or that, it is about the fundamental relationship that we have with ourselves. Everything arises from there.\n\nSo yes, there will be a reset. And it will come from each person that will accept to be part of one of this journeys. If one person changes, it impacts every other aspect of their reality, including the people that they relate with, the way they do their job, their health, everything. I’m thinking right now about a friend of my parents that is deep, very deep into the hole of suffering. Every day digging a little bit further down. There doesn’t seem to be an escape for him, but sure there is. When there is that kind of polarity in the way of existing, I’m sure that the other one is present, latent and waiting to be experienced. That is what Carmelo told us about the other day.\n\nHe was an old worker man that hitchhiked us one week ago and told us the story from where he was in the streets, drinking all day, absolutely lost and ready to die. He had a moment of opening his eyes with a woman that told her about god, and then he went to a forest, fell down to his knees and asked for help. He saw the feet of god, that is what he interpreted, and from there on everything in his life changed. His whole relationship with life was a transformed just by that interaction. So yes, he is an example of how being at the pit of the suffering can be the means by which a bigger understanding of this whole thing can arise. Ge is a clear example of that, and life brought me to him because that is what I needed to hear. He is the master that I needed to meet. It doesn’t need to be the most enlightened master that knows all the scriptures, there is no point in that. What matters is the way on which they relate to themselves, and their life, and Carmelo was a great example of what I’m talking here. Having a particular experience that changes the fundamental interaction with reality of the person.\nAnd this is what people need right now, this is the great reset. There are higher levels of depression than ever, people are suffering like crazy, they don’t know what to do, they are lost in the materiality of life, and there needs to be an atomic bomb of consciousness that comes so that that can change. So that there can be a reset, and a new beginning. And who is going to be there to guide the path on that new beginning? People like men, people like us, who are going to be the members of Dukkha and who will hold the space for transformation, both in ourselves, mainly in ourselves, but also in each other. We will be a community of people just Doing The Work. Just facing the hard truth of how life plays games to us, and always brings something new.\n\nI have written in previous days that Dukkha is for those who are serious in the path to awakening. But who does that let outside? Could Carmelo get in if he wanted? Probably he would not have felt represented by what was being conveyed with that message, because he could not have conceptualized that the way out of what he was experiencing was this path. Probably he would have been in another spot, in another place, and he would have been rejected by this strong message of ‘you need to be serious in the path of enlightenment to get into this place’. Who is talking when I write that? Am I being tender? Am I opening the doors to those who I want to help? I don’t think so. I think I’m being rough, and too extreme. It is one thing for me to be extreme and relate to life the way I do, in that constant quest of evolving as a human being, but another thing is to build something from there with other people. And I want to build for other people. I want to be there for them. I want to pave the road. And it is very important to acknowledge that the road that I have walked is not for everyone. It is mainly for no one.\n\nFew people would go to the forest, pitch their tent, and take all the LSD that they would find. Few people would be at a Ozora, take all the LSD and go to explore what life brings in the festival. Few people would take 6 grams of mushrooms on their own in the room of their house. Few people would become a Kundalini Yoga instructor to deepen their relationship with the practice. Few people would take a plane to go to the other side of the world to be part of a retreat where they would work with Iboga and a lot of meditation and other techniques. And who knows what else.\n\nI’m not like many people, I’m very special in relation to the intensity that I bring into my path, and it is time to acknowledge that so that I can become a better helper for the people that are going to be part of what I build. I’m creating something here, some days I forget it, but in other moments there is a strong drive that helps me realize what I am doing. It is very important for me to keep that in mind, as much as I can, so that I can truly embody what I’m doing and clarify it. Doing The Work is that, actually doing it, and these last weeks I have been in a blurry place related to that. I have not been completely focused on my writing, and because of that, I have not been in a place of clarity. In a place that gives me the understanding that I know what I’m doing, I know where I am heading to, and I know what this whole thing is about. There is a deep need inside me related to helping people, and showing up to Do The Work, sitting down to write, is the creative expression that I need to bring it all out.\n\nYesterday I thought that writing tweets was something similar to that, but it isn’t. It is not the same to sit down for 4 hours to just write as part of this Manifesto. The whole thing is different, because I’m relating to different people, I’m not focused on what is happening here, and I’m not bringing from my unconscious the information that will be the one that builds this whole project. It is a whole different game that one, and writing this line I acknowledge it. This was what needed to happen in order for you to realize what you had to do. Get back on track. Get back on track. The world needs you on track. You need you on track. All that suffering because of being lost is just noise, it is just noise that is bringing you down. Help yourself not to be brought down. Just give you that opportunity. It is the same as in meditation. You start the practice by focusing in the breath, and suddenly you realized that you are thinking about the burger that you are going to eat afterwards. It’s ok, it’s part of the game of the mind. Acknowledge that you realized that you were thinking, and go back to the breath. This is the practice, always going back. If you fall out of track and you are suffering from the consequences of not trusting why you are doing the work, or what you are doing, as soon as you realize that, acknowledge it has happened, and go back to do the work. In my case, it is just coming back here and writing whatever comes to mind. Just throwing it out of my mind and into this screen. Because it is not a piece of paper. We are beyond that right now. So yes, acknowledge that it has happened, and just go back. It is the same with everything, holy shit. That is the power of meditation actually. It teaches you not to be hard on yourself when you do something that you are not supposed to do. It teaches you that it is ok, and that every moment is a new opportunity to start again. And that eventually trains your system not to be hard with itself. It trains the conceptualization that you have of ‘you’ to not be hard with itself. And that is freeing. Right now, I feel a sensation of freedom. I spent all this time blaming myself and telling me that I’m not good enough because I am lost and I don’t know what I’m doing. It is part of it. It is part of what comes from this whole thing, it is part of Doing The Work. Acknowledge it, and come back. Without judgements, there is no use on judging, or blaming, or whatever. Just accept what is, what truly is, and go back. You are already out of track, there is nothing that you can do about it more than acknowledging it and going back. Always like that, always that pendulum that will teach you that the long term is way more important than the short term.\n\nAnd this is where Dukkha will start having its momentum. On doing the work. This project will start with artists, that will trust in it enough to go for it all in. That is what is needed, for them to realize the power that this whole thing has. I have not been focusing enough on artists, and those are the ones that I should be focusing because they are the ones that Do The Work. I’m thinking about Noxx, who I exchanged some tweets with, and who taught me about the importance of just showing up to win this battle with the mind. What if I invite him to be part of the first session of Dukkha, and with his help I co-create this whole thing? So the idea that is being shown right now is that the artist goes through all this process, working 4 hours every day for 21 days, and the consequence of that work is an NFT that is associated with Dukkha. Whatever it may be, and it doesn’t even have to be an artist. Whoever can come and work 4 hours every day for 21 days, and create something. It doesn’t need to be something cool, it doesn’t need to be something out of this world. It just is. It is part of it. We are all artists on the true sense of the word, and the problem with the way that we view it is that we think that the creation of someone that has been in the craft for 40 years is more valuable than the one of someone that has been only 21 days. Yes, it may be more valuable because of his experience, but what if there is a banker that has never done a painting and he comes here and does something amazing that expresses a whole aspect of his being that he didn’t know existed? How does that relate to the quality of his craft? I think that there is a huge value on that. A huge value on the creation of something that doesn’t exist yet, and on participating on something like this. And the thing is that it has to be recorded, and it has to be 4 hours in a row. That is the important part of the game, because it is what will teach you what it is to be consistent, to show up, to Do The Work. Really, is it necessary to be like that strict? I don’t think so. It doesn’t make sense. With this, I’m deleting what I just wrote because it doesn’t make sense. I have been iterating the way I do things, and I have realized that it is better for me to work 2 hours early in the morning and then 2 hours after my breathwork and meditation, and it is perfectly ok like that. It gives me the space for growth. It gives me the space, that is the word. It is about doing the hard work first and then being free of it. That is the game. That is what I’m actually doing right now, having written all this today and being 6:22 in the morning. I woke up very early and it feels fucking amazing, and this is the thing, this is doing the work. It feels so good to do the work, and now I realize how much I had been avoiding it because it is scary. It is scary to show up and not know what you will write about, what will come up. Will it be interesting for others to read? Who knows, it doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is that I’m able to show up and Do The Work. That is what I’m preaching about, and that is what I’m going to do. This is the moment on which I understand the relationship of the meditation practice and life itself. It is all about giving me the space to realize. To notice. To be the witness of what is going on. Not judging it, not feeling bad that it has happened. Just acknowledge it, and from there, move on. From there build. From there, show up again, and again, and again. That is the creative process. That is what it brings. Clarity. Consistency. Strength. Power. Beauty. Love. Passion. Energy. Motivation. Selflessness. Rhythm. Presence.\n\nYes, it is all about presence. It is all about being here, right now, and for that it is very important to acknowledge the work that has been done. Nothing else matters. The rest is just noise. Everything that goes around is just noise, which is cleared when there is the motivation enough to come here, sit down, and start writing whatever comes to mind. It may be noise for the reader, yes, maybe, but for me it is just an expression of who I am. It is what needs to come out, to be vomited, for me to become more of who I am. I don’t need to speak about it loudly. I just need to show up. The Work speaks for itself. No need to use fancy words, no need to use lights and confetti. Nope, just show up and do the work. Just be myself. That is all what is needed. The rest is just noise. Every piece that I create is a miracle. Everything. That is what I need to trust my work. Realize everything that is going on and trust. Just trust. Just trust. Things will end up making sense. Just show up and trust. I have not been able to trust completely yet, I’m scared, but it is enough. Not anymore. I don’t need to be scared anymore. I just need to be. I just need to open myself to what is at the other side of sharing who I am completely and absolutely, without filters, and this is the best way that exists for me to do that. Show up, write down whatever comes to mind, and just let it be. There will be people that feel bored about it, yes, but it really doesn’t matter. What matters is taking it out. What matters is creating something new, something that has not existed before, and build it up from there. What matters is just being myself. Just sharing everything that I will become.\n\nA book is being written, day by day, and it is the book of my life. It is the book of your life. It is the book of who you are. Are you letting that happen? Are you permitting the life force to flow through your whole system? Are you letting it out? There needs to be an expression of who you are in the world, if you don’t have it, it is time for you to build it. Build yourself a system that enables you to create. You need to create. We came here for that. We are a creative force of nature, that’s all we are. Embrace it and start creating.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what it is really, what matters is that you sit down with the intention of showing up to Do The Work. Think of it as a ritual. Think of it as something sacred. Think of it as the means by which you connect with what is beyond the understandable. Open up for that connection. It’s nice. It’s quite amazing. People throughout history have talked about it extensively, and that is where you connect to the source. What we historically have conceived as God is a void from which all creativity arises, and as soon as you Do The Work of permitting it flow through your system, you have to start creating. It is just part of the game, it is just what it is. I’m absolutely sure that the future holds for us an explosion into creativity, and what will end up happening is that more and more people will realize the importance of the creative act in the wellbeing of themselves. Connecting to spirit is amazing. We are spirit, and we long for that connection which has been lost, shattered, in the modern world. But that doesn’t need to be like that. It is time to wake up, and waking up is realizing that you came here to create. You are way more than what you think.\n",

I\\u2019m thinking right now about a friend of my parents that is deep, very deep into the hole of suffering. Every day digging a little bit further down. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be an escape for him, but sure there is.

He had a moment of opening his eyes with a woman that told her about god, and then he went to a forest, fell down to his knees and asked for help. He saw the feet of god, that is what he interpreted, and from there on everything in his life changed. His whole relationship with life was a transformed just by that interaction. So yes, he is an example of how being at the pit of the suffering can be the means by which a bigger understanding of this whole thing can arise. Ge is a clear example of that, and life brought me to him because that is what I needed to hear. He is the master that I needed to meet. It doesn\\u2019t need to be the most enlightened master that knows all the scriptures, there is no point in that. What matters is the way on which they relate to themselves, and their life, and Carmelo was a great example of what I\\u2019m talking here. Having a particular experience that changes the fundamental interaction with reality of the person.\nAnd this is what people need right now, this is the great reset. There are higher levels of depression than ever, people are suffering like crazy, they don\\u2019t know what to do, they are lost in the materiality of life, and there needs to be an atomic bomb of consciousness that comes so that that can change. So that there can be a reset, and a new beginning. And who is going to be there to guide the path on that new beginning? People like men, people like us, who are going to be the members of Dukkha and who will hold the space for transformation, both in ourselves, mainly in ourselves, but also in each other.

          "raw": "\nThere was a slight tentation to go to another place and start checking social media, or my email, or whatever that was different from coming here just to write. I just ended my morning meditation and there has been a feeling inside as if I was dirty, impure, just because yesterday I smoked weed (a lot) and today I was not able to wake up early to do the stuff that I usually do in the morning. That has me here starting to write at this time, instead of before the sunrise. So many things come to me related to this circumstance… My relationship with substances (mainly alcohol, weed and sugar), and the boundaries of discipline.\n\nDuring the last two years I have been dancing very often with the ‘this is the last time I do X’. And X mainly has been about those 3 substances. It has been very hard for me to be consistent with that willingness to have them outside my life, because they often make that noise in there related to them being necessary. And I don’t have complete clarity related to why they are important. What is the thing about them that has them inside my consciousness making this noise still. Writing this is my exploration into walking towards and integration of that, so that I can eventually move on.\n\nWhy do I keep falling into that pattern? Yesterday we began our first family project in a long time, and we started preparing the soil to plant the first vegetables in our garden. It was a lovely moment, and it is very exciting to start doing something like this. Even our little daughter was there, helping us taking out the soil with her small little hands. But there was this noise inside me that that moment could have been enhanced by smoking weed, because it was such a ‘mundane’ moment that smoking would have made it good. And yes, it brought a lot of things, good ideas and stuff, but the thing is that because of smoking I tend to avoid experiencing certain feelings and sensations in my body and consciousness, because I am actually in an altered state of consciousness. For example, afterwards I tweeted something that was very important, tagging an important account, and I don’t recall feeling very nervous about it. And usually I would have felt very nervous, and that is information for me to move on and integrate what I have inside. It is important to face the fact that I feel nervous. And yesterday it was not there, because of being high. But the intersting part is that today it was there, and having done what I did actually brought interesting stuff today. As I write, it is all present, and what I’m realizing now is that it doesn’t serve any purpose to fight with it. It is important for me to acknowledge why I do stuff, and be conscious every time that I’m doing them which is the purpose of it.\n\nWhen I smoke week, ask myself: Am I avoiding something with this?\nWhen I drink alcohol, ask myself: Am I avoiding something with this?\n\nAsking these questions will help me clarify my relationship with the particular substance, and with that, make peace with the fact that I used because of that purpose. It doesn’t do any good to me to be blaming myself for having done something that is not good for me in this moment of life. Who knows? I spent a big chunk of my life drinking as if the world was going to end. Is it good for me to say that it didn’t serve any purpose in my life? I was truly having a great time, I was truly having fun and enjoying every second of it. Now I look back and of course that I would have done it differently because the amount of neurons that I killed is ridiculous, it was too much, but it did serve a purpose. And if it didn’t, it doesn’t matter, because it is the reality of the things that already happened. The whole practice is being equanimous with that, and accepting it.\n\nThat was something that was present today in my practice of meditation, as I was going through this small inside blaming for having smoked yesterday. I was telling myself: You already did it, its part of reality, and just have in mind this for the next time so that you an make a more informed decision about what you are going to do. Are you willing to sacrifice the energy that you have when you wake up early for being high working on the garden? Are you willing to give up a good night sleep for being high a bit? Are you willing to give up part of your memory? (I d0n’t think I remember everything that happened).\n\nYea, so the thing about this stimulants and mind altering substances is that they take me out of my center. Am I moving towards a state of not taking anything and just being a samurai with what I do, full focused? What does that bring? How does that speak about myself? The thing is that I have inside this structure of thought related to being rigid not being good. It is what society has told me, and my mind always plays the trick of saying to me: It’s just once a week, it’s ok. But what is the prize that I end up paying for that one time? Is it worth it? And that is the question that I have to ask myself with every substance that I decide to take consciously, responsibly and having the question in mind: Is this helping me? Why am I doing this?\n\nI absolutely see that it is hard for me to ask this question to myself. But I’m moving towards there, it is part of this process of transformation. It is the same that when in meditation I go into a stream of thought, and then I remember that I was meditating and come back. In the world of addictions, I go towards one, and then a few hours later I remember where I was, I feel a little bad about having done the thing, and then I come back. It’s that eternal game. And I also say that it is the last time I’m going to do it.\n\nI guess that the important thing to have in mind here is related to the effect that they have in my capacity of Doing The Work. I guess it is related to the importance that I give to The Work, and to every moment in my life. Because it happens to me that sometimes I smoke weed because I will be in a place where the people will be too boring for me to be there. Or I drink alcohol because it is the only way to have fun and resonate in the frequency of those who will be there. But what am I avoiding with that? Where do I want to get with it? I’m inside a loop, because for example if I’m going to a concert there is always this noise inside me that I should smoke weed to have fun in it. To enjoy the music deeply. Is that the truth? Do I really need it? That circumstance that I’m going to experience is unique: Do I truly want to experience it through the filter of having taken something external to enjoy it purely or do I want to go through it with all of who I am in that moment, without external stuff? I want to move towards the latter, because there is a deep need inside me of not needing something particular to enjoy reality completely. It is part of all the work that I have been doing, and it is a very important part to acknowledge what I have said here.\n\nThe mind is blurry today, it seems like everything that has been written is just noise. It is just me trying to fit into a particular way of doing things, into a particular set of limitations. It is just what it is, I already did it and it is good to acknowledge and move on. Come on, just move on and live this moment without that blaming of things to have been different. You did it, you enjoyed it, and it is good like that.\n\nThat brings me to the other point, the one of discipline. What is what comes out for me in an experience like this? Having gone ‘out of track’, letting the discipline free and coming back to work with these sensations inside? I guess that the question is always: Is it worth it? Because of course the weed brings good and nice sensations into the system, and it is cool to do it, but how is that coolness compared to the feelings that come when I realize that I was able to show up and do the work, consistently and motivated?\n\nThe kind of feeling that shows up as a consequence of discipline is much deeper than the one that is associated with these kinds of habits, that eventually bring this negative feelings inside. I have fun, I enjoy, but then I feel bad. Do I want to keep feeling bad? Is it worth it? Probably not, so it is time for me to accept that and have it in mind the next time that I decide to do something that alters my consciousness. And not that really, but something that alters my schedule and what I have kind of optimized for me to work good. Eating is a great example of this also. I already know that if I eat in the night I feel horrible until the next morning, so each time that I decide consciously to eat in the night I’m opening the window to these sensations to arise. I need to be responsible for them, because they are part of the reality of what I am experiencing.\n\nBut the most important window that I need to open is the one of the understanding of how I feel in the moment on which I’m thinking about doing the stuff. Next time that I think about smoking weed in a particular situation, take a long moment to think about that situation and ask myself: Am I experiencing this moment from a place of division that I think will be closed up by doing this? That is what is present in me when I drink alcohol. There is a division between me and my experience of what is happening. I feel that drinking will close the gap between my consciousness and the one of the people that are there. It will create a buffer that will help us communicate in the same frequency. It will bring us together, because there is some division in there.\n\nAnd that is the big fallacy that it is important for me to address. That is the information that I need so that I can make the progress that I need to make with what I’m doing. Because that information is gold. That feeling of division is the key to all what has been experienced by me as a human being. How did I feel when I went to a party and I was sober? What was present in me? How am I dealing with that in this moment of my life? This are all questions that arise from the fact of having done something like this, and I repeat: The important part is just having them in mind. Every time that I decide consciously to do something, feel it in myself. Is there any division present? How is that division talking to me about who I am?\n\nAnd with that information move on. Go within. Those are the windows within that I have not completely explored yet, because probably they are the ones that are harder for me to navigate. Boredom is very hard for me to navigate. The doing of repetitive stuff, the being with people that I don’t resonate, etc. Those are things that speak to me about this feelings of division, and it will be important for me to address those so that I can better know myself.\n\nAnd how does all this story relate to Dukkha? Because this project is a journey into a deeper understanding of the self, and what I have talked about are key components of our modern society that help us evade the feelings that are present because of the circumstances of our life. Each TJ in Dukkha will consist of a bunch of people going through a particular journey, and it is not good to limit what they can or can’t do in their life, it is just part of what they decide to do, but the good thing will be to have in mind what I have talked about here and give them the understanding that it is important to be a witness of the decisions that they make, and what they are talking to them about who they are. About their relationship with themselves. And the important thing about it is not to be a bully and say that something is right or wrong. No one will judge anyone because of having gone into a particular behavior. It is part of the game. The important part will be to create the means for them to integrate that experience in a way that is conducent to the evolution that we are aiming to create in the individual, so that each person is able to be conscious about their actions in the truest sense. A lot of this patterns of action are unconscious, and as they are made conscious there is a big release of energy and a sense of freedom that is good. It is a step by step process, but we will all be there for each other. That is the nice thing.\n\nIt’s crazy to open the internet to play some music and end up doing a completely different thing. It was a short moment, but the amount of information in there is absolutely overwhelming. Our brains are fried!\n\nOk, so back to how this whole thing that I have been talking about addictions helps in Dukkha. I still haven’t resolved the issue of addictions in my way of thinking, because probably if you asked a person that deals with alcoholics about his relationship with alcohol, he would say that the way to go is to not use it at all. It is as if a window would open, and there would be a going back to that old pattern. Does that mean that the pattern is healed in any way? I truly don’t think so, because there is always this avoidance of just staring at the relationship with the substance, and integrate the role that it has played in the life of the individual. If there is a person that hasn’t drunk in 16 years and suddenly he drinks and becomes an alcoholic again… Does that mean that those whole 16 years he was deceiving himself? And in those 16 years, what is the role that alcohol has played in his life? I’m talking from an unconscious level here: What does the restriction that comes from actively avoiding something that you are addicted to bring into your life? I wonder, because I think that there is something there that is not resolved. For example this week I told myself that I would not drink for one year. Is that helping me to better understand my relationship with alcohol? Or the fact that I decide to drink again and face the feelings that I am facing in this moment (caused by weed, but they are similar) teaches me more about it and actually moves me toward a state of ‘healing’ because I’m actually dealing with the thing?\n\nI don’t have a clue related to this question, and perhaps it is because I have never truly dealt with an addict in my life. I don’t completely know what it is like. I was very, very good at drinking, but I would not say I’m addicted to alcohol because I don’t have any problem to not drink. But that is only my experience. It doesn’t work for others.\n\nHow will we deal in Dukkha with people that have addictions?\n\nA big part of me tells me that I need to have a better understanding of this whole thing, but that part is the one that wants to create a conceptual frame of reference from which to evaluate situations. It is not the part that wants to free himself from suffering so that he can become a mirror for the experience of other human beings. Because each of us is a unique individual, each one with his own limitations, challenges and experiences, and if I have a conceptual understanding of this thing I will tend to ‘frame’ people more. I will tend to bring them into a particular basket, and with that, separate myself from the experience of just being for them. I think that wanting to better know this subject is me trying to control, trying to help, when what is needed is for people to be able to help themselves. I just need to provide the means for that to happen, and those means are my absolute and complete presence for their experience. Just being there for them. Not help them understand what they are going through, there are people that are better than me for that, but just being there for them and listening to what they have to say, so that they can get their own conclusions and they can go through their own healing because of that. That is the game that I will understand how to play. That is the one that makes more sense to me. It is not that I’m lazy and I don’t want to study the stuff that will help me understand, it is maybe that I don’t want to understand. I just want to experience.\n\nRight now, I don’t have a conceptual understanding of why I decided to smoke weed yesterday, or eat sugar on Tuesday, or drink ‘my last beer’. Do I need it? I don’t think so. What I need is just to feel what I’m feeling, and go through it from my own lens. To be a witness of myself, and from that process develop a deeper relationship with the circumstances of my life. With my relationship with life. Only through that I will be able to evolve. Because if I fit myself into a particular label, for example that ‘I don’t drink alcohol’, I will be inhabiting from this perspective of separation, of division. There is a sense inside me that there is division present on categorizing me as a person that doesn’t drink alcohol, because I shut myself from the experience of drinking alcohol if I feel like. And I don’t want to limit my experience as a human being, I just want to open it up and let it it. Whatever it brings. As I was meditating today I had this image of the punisher god that was telling me that what I did was wrong, that I should not have done it. And there was the shoulding again. You shouldn’t do this, you shouldn’t do that. Who knows… The only reality is that I did it, and the only reality is that it is part of my existence right now and food for what I will do tomorrow. That is all that matters, and I watch it with compassion towards myself, and from there move on.\n\nThat is what I want to bring into Dukkha, this understanding of compassion towards the self more than everything. You will make mistakes, you will miss Doing The Work, you will do something that you ‘shouldn’t’ do, and it is ok. The important piece is just being conscious of it, and move on with the understanding that it brought. That is to play the game, that is to move towards being free. Freedom is opening every window in the human experience, and making the conscious decision of going through the one that feels good for you. Without looking behind, just realizing that each moment is a new opportunity. Each moment is a new window to look deeper within yourself, and through that process, get to know you better. That is the most that you can do, and I can’t do it for you. You have to go in there by yourself. You have to face that blaming, those afterthoughts that you ‘shouldn’t’, etc. You are the one that has that voice inside, and I just want to invite you to be a witness of that voice and ask yourself: Who is the one that is blaming? Who is the one that feels bad? Who is the one that made that decision that now is being regretted? And from that inquiry go deeper, closer (in)to the truth.\n\nThe only way in is through.\n\nThat is what is being shown in this moment, in this blurry moment when there is not clarity of all the thing. And probably there is not clarity because there is still this feeling of division, of wanting for stuff to be different. But I’m moving a little bit towards the healing of that division, and it feels good.\n\nIt’s crazy to have spent all this time debating with myself about the consequences of having smoked weed yesterday. Sometimes I can be hard with myself, and that’s why having a community of people that are going through the shit is helpful. If Dukkha already existed and there was a group of people in there going through a TJ, we could talk to each other, and help each other in this journey into compassion.\n\nIt is about having all this people around just to remind you that you have to go through your shit on your own. At the end of the day, it is just you with yourself. You are the one that has to show up, Do The Work and integrate whatever shit is going on. In my case, it is this eternal dance with my addictions and things that are very hard for me to give up, and in your case it may be something completely different. Just acknowledge it, and embrace it, and move on with that understanding. Always be willing to dive a bit deeper so that you can grow from each thing that happens in your life. If it is a shouldn’t or not. It doesn’t matter. They are all information that can remind you about the infinite aspect of life. About the eternal mystery of why we are here. That is the game. That is the amazing game.\n\nAnd which is the role that a psychology could play in this whole process? To help that information to be brought up, so that you can better deal with it after it has surfaced. I don’t know. Maybe I’m just running in circles in here, but it is just what it is. I won’t judge myself. And the question in the background runs: And how does this relate to Dukkha? Remember that this whole thing is the manifesto of the DAO. And I can’t even write down the manifesto, because I truly don’t know what I’m writing about. It seems to be just noise, but it is the noise that is coming from the purity of my experience. My goal in this place, with these writings, is to be as sincere as I can be so that I can share everything that I’m going through in this process. The manifesto is just that, a translation of my experience of bringing the shit out of the unconscious so that I can process it and with that become more human. More animal. I can’t outline anything that is outside my experience, because I’m kind of closed to that. In this process and in this moment of my life, I’m just taking care of dealing with what is going on through me. It is very intense like this, so I’m good with it. I can’t speak about the experience of other people, and I won’t to it. I’m just here for myself, sharing what is going on with me, so that you, when you read this, realize that you are not the only one that is crazy. I’m crazy too. And I embrace it. I hope that you embrace it also because it is the only way on which you are going to be able to evolve. To go through this whole process, accepting everything that you have been and everything that you are.\n\nHow does this whole thing relate to Dukkha? Because it speaks about my transparency. I’m not coming here to pretend to be something I’m not, I’m coming here to be everything that I am. And what is present in my experience right now is all what I have shared here, and I love it as it is. I share it with you just for you to know. Or just for me to know. Just for me to process it, and with that, move forward. Move into a new relationship with those things that make noise inside me, that won’t let me see with the clarity that I need. Yesterday I sent messages that may be embarrassing, but they were talked from my heart. I’m relating to life with my heart in here.\n\nYesterday we had an episode with my partner on which I realized that I had made a mistake, and I was able to tell her about having made a mistake sooner than before. How great is that feeling of having realized that you did something wrong, and actually be able to say: I’m sorry. I made a mistake. How great is that feeling and how often we avoid feeling it because of not being willing to give up our pride. What does open in a relationship between human beings when there is one that is willing to say I’m sorry, I made a mistake? And what does that bring into the communication, into the flow between each of them? It was a magical moment really, because I could feel how her defenses were being lowered. It ended up with a hug, and we moved on. This is a new example of realizing the stuff in the moment that it is experienced, and how this whole process of presence is that, just a process. Just moving step by step into a deeper understanding of myself so that I can realize earlier why I’m doing what I’m doing, and what it is bringing into my experience of life. That’s the journey, each day move towards a better understanding of how I life and what is present in me when I decide to do what I do. That understanding is the one that brings true freedom, because it lets me choose from a place of awareness, from a place of being conscious. Being responsible. Standing strong and building from there.\n\nSomething important that came through yesterday was related to a question that was asked by What I’ve Learned in YouTube:\nDo you think the Buddhist concept of Enlightenment / Awakening is real?\n\nThe interesting part of it is that the first answer to the poll was this one: Yes, and anyone with enough extra time can achieve it.\n\nWhen I read it I felt a weird feeling inside, as if I had been attacked, because of what I have done and where I have gotten in the understanding of this thing. I hate to say the understanding because that comes from the level of mind and I don’t want this thing to come from the level of mind because that I know that the way to make ‘progress’ is to experience from a different place but anyway, no way out of it right now. So yes. I have enough time because life has given me the opportunity to explore, so of course that I am one of the ones that thinks that yes, it exists. But then I was thinking about my grandparent, and my great-grandparent, and realizing: They were very curious people, and probably if they had known that something like this was a possibility, they would have gone through the process of going deeper into its discovery. How would any curious person not want to know more about this if it is the ultimate realization that one can have in a lifetime? Realizing your own being is just it, there is nothing at the other side, and what comes from it is absolute freedom. Why wouldn’t you want to know the truth?\n\nAnd probably they would have liked to, who knows, and it was not a matter of time or money or energy. It was because of the society in which they lived, and the access of information that was available to them. Something like this was not accessible to people because there was a lot of noise between them and the concept of awakening. But now, with all the information that we have, we can realize that this is a thing, and help each other in the quest of this realization… Of truth. It is the greatest mystery of our lifetime, the greatest mystery of life itself, and as we transition into the new stage of our species this is the major shift that is going to happen. This is how we evolve, and finally we are heading towards that evolution. The veil of the dream is beginning to be lifted, and what lies at the other side is profoundly mysterious.\n\nDoors that are being opened, people that are starting to become curious. This is just starting.\n\nThe question that goes through the mind right now is: What is the purpose of this manifesto? It is just an exploration into what is alive as I go through this process of discovering the truth. I just come here and vomit what is present. There is not an underlying agenda because I don’t truly know where this is heading, and I don’t really care. I just show up for those that will come, for those that want to experience the same thing in their own flesh. It is not about the ones that will read, it is just about myself being myself. Just letting me be, with the witness of consciousness in front.\n",

(I d0n\\u2019t think I remember everything that happened).\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yea, so the thing about this stimulants and mind altering substances is that they take me out of my center. Am I moving towards a state of not taking anything and just being a samurai with what I do, full focused? What does that bring? How does that speak about myself? The thing is that I have inside this structure of thought related to being rigid not being good. It is what society has told me, and my mind always plays the trick of saying to me: It\\u2019s just once a week, it\\u2019s ok. But what is the prize that I end up paying for that one time? Is it worth it? And that is the question that I have to ask myself with every substance that I decide to take consciously, responsibly and having the question in mind: Is this helping me? Why am I doing this?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"I absolutely see that it is hard for me to ask this question to myself. But I\\u2019m moving towards there, it is part of this process of transformation. It is the same that when in meditation I go into a stream of thought, and then I remember that I was meditating and come back. In the world of addictions, I go towards one, and then a few hours later I remember where I was, I feel a little bad about having done the thing, and then I come back. It\\u2019s that eternal game. And I also say that it is the last time I\\u2019m going to do it.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"I guess that the important thing to have in mind here is related to the effect that they have in my capacity of Doing The Work. I guess it is related to the importance that I give to The Work, and to every moment in my life. Because it happens to me that sometimes I smoke weed because I will be in a place where the people will be too boring for me to be there. Or I drink alcohol because it is the only way to have fun and resonate in the frequency of those who will be there. But what am I avoiding with that? Where do I want to get with it? I\\u2019m inside a loop, because for example if I\\u2019m going to a concert there is always this noise inside me that I should smoke weed to have fun in it. To enjoy the music deeply. Is that the truth? Do I really need it? That circumstance that I\\u2019m going to experience is unique: Do I truly want to experience it through the filter of having taken something external to enjoy it purely or do I want to go through it with all of who I am in that moment, without external stuff? I want to move towards the latter, because there is a deep need inside me of not needing something particular to enjoy reality completely. It is part of all the work that I have been doing, and it is a very important part to acknowledge what I have said here.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"The mind is blurry today, it seems like everything that has been written is just noise. It is just me trying to fit into a particular way of doing things, into a particular set of limitations. It is just what it is, I already did it and it is good to acknowledge and move on. Come on, just move on and live this moment without that blaming of things to have been different. You did it, you enjoyed it, and it is good like that.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"That brings me to the other point, the one of discipline. What is what comes out for me in an experience like this? Having gone \\u2018out of track\\u2019, letting the discipline free and coming back to work with these sensations inside? I guess that the question is always: Is it worth it? Because of course the weed brings good and nice sensations into the system, and it is cool to do it, but how is that coolness compared to the feelings that come when I realize that I was able to show up and do the work, consistently and motivated?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"The kind of feeling that shows up as a consequence of discipline is much deeper than the one that is associated with these kinds of habits, that eventually bring this negative feelings inside. I have fun, I enjoy, but then I feel bad. Do I want to keep feeling bad? Is it worth it? Probably not, so it is time for me to accept that and have it in mind the next time that I decide to do something that alters my consciousness. And not that really, but something that alters my schedule and what I have kind of optimized for me to work good. Eating is a great example of this also. I already know that if I eat in the night I feel horrible until the next morning, so each time that I decide consciously to eat in the night I\\u2019m opening the window to these sensations to arise. I need to be responsible for them, because they are part of the reality of what I am experiencing.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"But the most important window that I need to open is the one of the understanding of how I feel in the moment on which I\\u2019m thinking about doing the stuff. Next time that I think about smoking weed in a particular situation, take a long moment to think about that situation and ask myself: Am I experiencing this moment from a place of division that I think will be closed up by doing this? That is what is present in me when I drink alcohol. There is a division between me and my experience of what is happening. I feel that drinking will close the gap between my consciousness and the one of the people that are there. It will create a buffer that will help us communicate in the same frequency. It will bring us together, because there is some division in there.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And that is the big fallacy that it is important for me to address. That is the information that I need so that I can make the progress that I need to make with what I\\u2019m doing. Because that information is gold. That feeling of division is the key to all what has been experienced by me as a human being. How did I feel when I went to a party and I was sober? What was present in me? How am I dealing with that in this moment of my life? This are all questions that arise from the fact of having done something like this, and I repeat: The important part is just having them in mind. Every time that I decide consciously to do something, feel it in myself. Is there any division present? How is that division talking to me about who I am?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And with that information move on. Go within. Those are the windows within that I have not completely explored yet, because probably they are the ones that are harder for me to navigate. Boredom is very hard for me to navigate. The doing of repetitive stuff, the being with people that I don\\u2019t resonate, etc. Those are things that speak to me about this feelings of division, and it will be important for me to address those so that I can better know myself.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And how does all this story relate to Dukkha? Because this project is a journey into a deeper understanding of the self, and what I have talked about are key components of our modern society that help us evade the feelings that are present because of the circumstances of our life. Each TJ in Dukkha will consist of a bunch of people going through a particular journey, and it is not good to limit what they can or can\\u2019t do in their life, it is just part of what they decide to do, but the good thing will be to have in mind what I have talked about here and give them the understanding that it is important to be a witness of the decisions that they make, and what they are talking to them about who they are. About their relationship with themselves. And the important thing about it is not to be a bully and say that something is right or wrong. No one will judge anyone because of having gone into a particular behavior. It is part of the game. The important part will be to create the means for them to integrate that experience in a way that is conducent to the evolution that we are aiming to create in the individual, so that each person is able to be conscious about their actions in the truest sense. A lot of this patterns of action are unconscious, and as they are made conscious there is a big release of energy and a sense of freedom that is good. It is a step by step process, but we will all be there for each other. That is the nice thing.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"It\\u2019s crazy to open the internet to play some music and end up doing a completely different thing.

I still haven\\u2019t resolved the issue of addictions in my way of thinking, because probably if you asked a person that deals with alcoholics about his relationship with alcohol, he would say that the way to go is to not use it at all. It is as if a window would open, and there would be a going back to that old pattern. Does that mean that the pattern is healed in any way? I truly don\\u2019t think so, because there is always this avoidance of just staring at the relationship with the substance, and integrate the role that it has played in the life of the individual. If there is a person that hasn\\u2019t drunk in 16 years and suddenly he drinks and becomes an alcoholic again\\u2026 Does that mean that those whole 16 years he was deceiving himself? And in those 16 years, what is the role that alcohol has played in his life? I\\u2019m talking from an unconscious level here: What does the restriction that comes from actively avoiding something that you are addicted to bring into your life? I wonder, because I think that there is something there that is not resolved. For example this week I told myself that I would not drink for one year. Is that helping me to better understand my relationship with alcohol? Or the fact that I decide to drink again and face the feelings that I am facing in this moment (caused by weed, but they are similar) teaches me more about it and actually moves me toward a state of \\u2018healing\\u2019 because I\\u2019m actually dealing with the thing?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"I don\\u2019t have a clue related to this question, and perhaps it is because I have never truly dealt with an addict in my life. I don\\u2019t completely know what it is like. I was very, very good at drinking, but I would not say I\\u2019m addicted to alcohol because I don\\u2019t have any problem to not drink. But that is only my experience. It doesn\\u2019t work for others.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"How will we deal in Dukkha with people that have addictions?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"A big part of me tells me that I need to have a better understanding of this whole thing, but that part is the one that wants to create a conceptual frame of reference from which to evaluate situations. It is not the part that wants to free himself from suffering so that he can become a mirror for the experience of other human beings. Because each of us is a unique individual, each one with his own limitations, challenges and experiences, and if I have a conceptual understanding of this thing I will tend to \\u2018frame\\u2019 people more. I will tend to bring them into a particular basket, and with that, separate myself from the experience of just being for them. I think that wanting to better know this subject is me trying to control, trying to help, when what is needed is for people to be able to help themselves. I just need to provide the means for that to happen, and those means are my absolute and complete presence for their experience. Just being there for them. Not help them understand what they are going through, there are people that are better than me for that, but just being there for them and listening to what they have to say, so that they can get their own conclusions and they can go through their own healing because of that. That is the game that I will understand how to play. That is the one that makes more sense to me. It is not that I\\u2019m lazy and I don\\u2019t want to study the stuff that will help me understand, it is maybe that I don\\u2019t want to understand. I just want to experience.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Right now, I don\\u2019t have a conceptual understanding of why I decided to smoke weed yesterday, or eat sugar on Tuesday, or drink \\u2018my last beer\\u2019. Do I need it? I don\\u2019t think so. What I need is just to feel what I\\u2019m feeling, and go through it from my own lens. To be a witness of myself, and from that process develop a deeper relationship with the circumstances of my life. With my relationship with life. Only through that I will be able to evolve. Because if I fit myself into a particular label, for example that \\u2018I don\\u2019t drink alcohol\\u2019, I will be inhabiting from this perspective of separation, of division. There is a sense inside me that there is division present on categorizing me as a person that doesn\\u2019t drink alcohol, because I shut myself from the experience of drinking alcohol if I feel like. And I don\\u2019t want to limit my experience as a human being, I just want to open it up and let it it. Whatever it brings. As I was meditating today I had this image of the punisher god that was telling me that what I did was wrong, that I should not have done it. And there was the shoulding again. You shouldn\\u2019t do this, you shouldn\\u2019t do that. Who knows\\u2026 The only reality is that I did it, and the only reality is that it is part of my existence right now and food for what I will do tomorrow.

You will make mistakes, you will miss Doing The Work, you will do something that you \\u2018shouldn\\u2019t\\u2019 do, and it is ok. The important piece is just being conscious of it, and move on with the understanding that it brought. That is to play the game, that is to move towards being free. Freedom is opening every window in the human experience, and making the conscious decision of going through the one that feels good for you. Without looking behind, just realizing that each moment is a new opportunity. Each moment is a new window to look deeper within yourself, and through that process, get to know you better. That is the most that you can do, and I can\\u2019t do it for you. You have to go in there by yourself. You have to face that blaming, those afterthoughts that you \\u2018shouldn\\u2019t\\u2019, etc. You are the one that has that voice inside, and I just want to invite you to be a witness of that voice and ask yourself: Who is the one that is blaming?

Just acknowledge it, and embrace it, and move on with that understanding. Always be willing to dive a bit deeper so that you can grow from each thing that happens in your life. If it is a shouldn\\u2019t or not. It doesn\\u2019t matter. They are all information that can remind you about the infinite aspect of life. About the eternal mystery of why we are here.

My goal in this place, with these writings, is to be as sincere as I can be so that I can share everything that I\\u2019m going through in this process. The manifesto is just that, a translation of my experience of bringing the shit out of the unconscious so that I can process it and with that become more human. More animal. I can\\u2019t outline anything that is outside my experience, because I\\u2019m kind of closed to that. In this process and in this moment of my life, I\\u2019m just taking care of dealing with what is going on through me. It is very intense like this, so I\\u2019m good with it. I can\\u2019t speak about the experience of other people, and I won\\u2019t to it. I\\u2019m just here for myself, sharing what is going on with me, so that you, when you read this, realize that you are not the only one that is crazy. I\\u2019m crazy too. And I embrace it.

Just for me to process it, and with that, move forward. Move into a new relationship with those things that make noise inside me, that won\\u2019t let me see with the clarity that I need.

How great is that feeling and how often we avoid feeling it because of not being willing to give up our pride. What does open in a relationship between human beings when there is one that is willing to say I\\u2019m sorry, I made a mistake? And what does that bring into the communication, into the flow between each of them? It was a magical moment really, because I could feel how her defenses were being lowered. It ended up with a hug, and we moved on. This is a new example of realizing the stuff in the moment that it is experienced, and how this whole process of presence is that, just a process. Just moving step by step into a deeper understanding of myself so that I can realize earlier why I\\u2019m doing what I\\u2019m doing, and what it is bringing into my experience of life. That\\u2019s the journey, each day move towards a better understanding of how I life and what is present in me when I decide to do what I do.

          "raw": "\nThese days of showing up and looking for people that resonate with the message that is coming through me in Social Media have been of enormous growth and understanding. I always thought about selling as showing a product or service to someone, and just letting that person be informed by what was being shown. Like presenting the offer and letting them decide (with me there, as a witness) if they want it or not.\n\nBut it doesn’t work like that anymore. I have sent the website of Dukkha to different people, and the problem with sending it cold like that is that I have to offer a clearer explanation of what it is with the message that is sent. For example, if I send an email to someone, and I add it as a PS, it sounds kind of desperate, and I have to try to explain what is difficult to explain. And I’m also basing my communication with that person as a transactional one, on which I want to sell, and that is not a healthy way to build friendships. I’m being too direct with it, I’m selling myself as a transactional object. And that doesn’t feel good. And it is not even close to working. It is the same as trying too hard to become awake. It just doesn’t work like that, you need to give it space. And for sharing my work it is the same, I have been doing it wrong.\n\nThe answer and what is better to do is just be myself and care about the other person, without the underlying motto of selling her something. Just connecting out of curiosity, not because I can win something from the interaction (I mean… Establishing a direct communication with another human being IS valuable, don’t get me wrong here). If that is done in a way that captures the attention of that person, I open the door for her to be a bit more curious about what Ido, and with that, engage in a deeper conversation about what it is about. But that conversation needs to start from the other person, out of curiosity. It is part of what it means to be patient, and to respect my work so that it shows itself in the world. That is the game that I’m learning how to play. Not the one of desperately seeking for attention, but the one of engaging and being social, so that I can grow with a new understanding of what it means to participate in these kind of networks.\n\nWhat am I here for?\n\nIf you develop a strong relationship with your mind, you will become unstoppable. All that creativity is waiting to be unleashed within yourself. I’ll teach you how to meditate, be creative and express your full potential. How to be away from time. How to forget that we are embedded in a cultural understanding of life as if there is an aspect of it called ‘time’. With my help, you will begin to melt time away, and realize that there is an infinite expression of creativity and presence that comes from just being in the moment. Using your breath as the anchor that brings your awareness into the experience of now. Of being here. Of just being. All that time that is spent in the mind, inventing a future that will never be as the one that you have hoped for. The ultimate intelligence is the ability to experience the present moment, of being here, now. That is where all true wisdom and capacity for being creative arises from.\n\nThe mind steps in the way, it likes being on stage. It likes having an illusion of control, it feels secure. The reason because it works like that is a lifetime navigating life with those patters of action in place. Doing their work. Helping you survive. But there needs to be a moment when there is a realization that there is nothing to be worried about, there is no harming force that wants to push you back and hold inside you all your creative potential. That force is just within yourself, and you are the one that is in charge of establishing a healthy relationship with that force so that You can be in the drivers seat. When I write the word You, who is the one that reads it? Ask yourself this question over and over, until the truth is set forth. Until there are no doubts about it.\n\nEvery doubt comes from the mind. It is the thing that doubts. Awareness is just aware, there is no doubt associated to the fact of just being aware. So ask yourself: Who is the one that doubts?\n\nI will point you towards the non-dual. I will pave the road for you, so that you don’t have to do what I have done to play this game. It is much simpler than that, but I have tried so hard to attain something that I’m on this eternal loop, on this eternal rat race within the confines of my own being. That is because of the trying to be free, when what is needed is only just being free. But truly embodying that being free. Just being. Free is a concept, and being is something that is beyond concepts. It just is. So stop trying anything, just be. Realize who you are by the magic of what you have always been, what has been hiding from your understanding all this time, looking for you as you look for something that is there, waiting for being discovered.\n\nI want to talk about something important now, and it is related to asking permission to Do The Work. There is a decision of going in and doing it, there is an opening for transformation, and it is important to help that process by acknowledging what is going to be done. How would it feel to just open up the space for asking my own body for permission to change it? How would the restructuring of my nervous system work if I opened the window to ask for permission to restructure it?\n\nAnd when there is no asking for permission, what comes is asking for forgiveness. Please forgive me, amazing body of mine, amazing mind that has come to join me in this lifetime, for all the work that I have done, all this time, without your permission. I have embarked in a deep quest of understanding what this whole thing is about, and that quest has for a long time been from a place of separation, from a place of thinking that there is something to be transcended, something to get rid from. I have been deep into a rabbit hole from which I don’t have the resources to go out, and I have been selfish. I have not acknowledged truly everything that you have done for me to get into this point, and now is the moment on which I realize that, and I tell you ‘I’m sorry’, But I did my best.\n\nThe same as a dad that is trying to put the little baby to sleep and looses his patience because of not being able to do it, he is doing his best with the resources he has. I also have done my best, and this is the moment on which I realize it. There is a deep sense of humility that comes from that. From realizing these kinds of things. It has been because of the rush of getting somewhere as soon as possible. I need to become free of suffering now, so that I can truly enjoy life. It doesn’t work like that. It is a process, on which you start realizing things in your life, moments, when the presence of mind is making you behave in a certain way that is not connected to spirit. When I come in a rush and I do my thing so that I can then do the next one, that is not connected with the magic of what is transcendent. It is just connected to the ego, that wants to do all these practices in order to ‘perfect itself’. There is no need for that. The only thing that is needed is to be sincere, and open, and compassionate. And the biggest compassion of all comes with oneself, and because of having written this I can realize that I have not been able to practice that in the confines of my own life experience.\n\nIt is never too bad, and probably I will forget this realization in the future, but it has happened. When I start a new session of Doing The Work I will have this in mind. Asking myself permission for a transformation. That is what ritualizing the whole thing is about, longing for that connection with the deepest aspect of myself, by integrating everything that I am into the present moment. I write about being in the present moment, but I know that I’m not truly experiencing life from that point. But I am discovering how to do it.\n\nWhat I’m here to do is to be a companion in your own journey of self discovery, of realizing the truth of who you are. I’m holding the space for your own transformation, with my words, with my creations. Welcome to the next chapter of your life.\n\nI’m not a guru that has answers, I’m just a curious guy that has an infinite amount of questions. They just won’t stop coming. Thank you for opening the space for me to ask them, for me to connect with your experience through engaging in this conversation.\n\nJorge Pablo Franetovic Stocker. The name that I have been given in my life is what represents me, it is who I have been calling myself and it is important to integrate everything that it brings into my experience. It is important to integrate everything that you have been until this moment, for there not to be any piece or aspect of separation. It will be felt as a flow of energy that comes as warm sensations, the ones of felling an opening. As if you were melting. As soon as you open yourself to be melted into the realization that you have always been everything that you will always be, there is no need to be running anymore. There is no need for being fixated in time, because what you are doing in that moment is a straight consequence of what you came here to do. It is just like that: magical. There is no separation between you and the consequence of your actions, and with the action itself. Mind melts and you just become what you are creating. Life creates through you, and in the moment you realize this and stop living in the mind, you will be free.\n\nFrom all the suffering that comes from willing for things to have been different, and from all the suffering that comes from building the expectations of something happening. In the future. That is where the noise start coming up, and it is very important to have in mind these limitations of the mind. This ways of operating that only bring despair and depression, and that are which have us in the state on which we are now, with such high rates of depression worldwide. That is a consequence of living in a moment different from what is truly here, and experiencing life from the point of ‘should’. A depressed person has an existential craving for things to be different from what they are. The only way in is through… What happens if that depressed person goes really, really deep and realizes that there is a fundamental level of existence that will bring peace and happiness? How would that world look like? How would that person look like?\n\nThat is what Dukkha is all about. Of realizing the truth of what is here and has always been, so that you can build your life on top of that understanding. Or more than an understanding, on top of that realization. It is something beyond understanding, it is something related to experience. It is time to have the experience, to realize what is possible, and change yourself in the process. Become all of what you can become, and truly enjoy every thing that is present in your life. Stop living from the state of being of separation, for you are not separated from anything. What is staring at you from the eyes of your enemy is awareness itself, the same as you are. Awareness is playing a game of hide and seek through each and every one of us, and it is getting tired of that game. It is starting to build a strong craving for realizing itself. Do you want to be one of the early adopters of this new way of existing as human beings? Are you ready to give up all of what you are to realize everything that you can become when you open the door to just be? Are you willing to give up the control of your life and open to the infinite stream of life? Does this resonate with you? When you answer that question, who is the you that is answering? Is that You? How does it feel to be You?\n\nAre you ready? Of course you are ready, you have always been. You have always been here, you just haven’t realized it yet because of all the games that your mind has been playing to You, thinking that there is something to be controlled, that there is a need of defending yourself, that there is something to be achieved, that there is something that needs to be changed. There is nothing like that, things are just perfect as they are. The biggest cliché of them all, but it is true in the deepest aspect of reality. You are already complete. Everything that you will ever be is already here, and what does not let you experience that is your mind. Wake up and realize that you are something different than your mind. Something that can’t be explained. It can’t be conceptualized. It can’t be witnessed. It can’t be seen.\n\nThe stream of words that come directly when there is no mediation, when there is no though, is everything that just is. This is just it. There is no need for it to be different, it is only what it is. I accept it and embrace it and move forward with it. With everything that has been. With everything that will ever be.\n\nThe ultimate experience that I have had in my life in terms of what I have gone through in a spiritual sense was after having a deep realization of the importance of the word balance in my life. There was a message that was brought to me related to my own balance, and there was a _knowing_ of where this place of balance was within my own system. I knew that I had been there in some moment of my existence, and I knew that I could go back to it, and there was no rush. And then, as I sat down in the cushion, there was a deep realization that time didn’t even matter. There was a knowing that time was just something that was created by an aspect of myself, but it was not everything that was there. It was not what determined what was happening. It was determined by this balance, by this deep knowing. ‘I have been there’, I told to myself. And that was all what I needed to listen. To feel close, to not feel alone. I had never been alone. It had always been here.\n\n—-\n\nThere will be more and more awakened persons, and it will be a process that will be exponential because of the nature of it. The probability that someone awakens to his or her own nature in the presence of someone that has already gone through that process is huge, and this is all what Dukkha is about. Bringing this to the collective level. What comes now is a depiction of the roadmap for the project, as it is imagined:\n\nFirst, there will be an online stage, on which people from all over the world will come to Do The Work together. The first Transformational Journey will consist of 21 days of mixing Doing The Work with Doing The Rest, with the intention for people to tap deeply into their creative potential. (The sun is rising in a strong mist of very orange colors, saying goodbye to a new moon that has been lighting the whole morning with its brightness. Nature is beautiful). The people that go through this journey will be transformed, and the idea is that they become part of the community because of this. A big aspect of being part of the community is to open up a space in their own town to Do The Work, so that they can spread the word locally. So we start online, we keep doing online TJ so that we can get the full power that is needed to spread the word in the offline world. The process of awakening will happen in a collective scale, and the people that are in charge of taking care of these places (that I have called nodes) in every part of the world are the keepers of wisdom. As the DAO grows, there will be the opportunity for funding these places, that I envision as small huts where people can go in and have an intense experience of transformation, especially with psychedelics. I don’t imagine it is a center where people can gather, that will be online, but it will be a place where one person goes to have a particular intense experience. This enables it to be built in the backyard of the keeper of wisdom, which makes it much more probable to happen. This node is envisioned as a place of exploration, and as a spaceship of the future. We have spent so much energy trying to reach for mars as a species, but the most important journey that we need to undertake is the one within. This node-spaceship will be the means for that, and people from all over the world will be in charge of them. Serving as the gatekeepers. As the commanders.\n\nThe next stage will be to work in the metaverse, with the MSquared way of creating stuff for the metaverse, so that people can express their full creative potential in the digital sphere. The goal for each TJ will be for someone to create a dedicated piece of art during the 21 days, that afterwards will be sold as an NFT and will be stored in a particular place in (probably) many metaverses. It can be open, and the fact that it is m2 accounts for it to be movable from one to the next. It doesn’t matter which metaverse it is, it matters that the object is in the wallet. So what will be built is a digital exploration into what a temple for beauty is. Something like the CoSM, the Chapel Of Sacred Mirrors that Alex and Allyson Grey built, but on the digital realm. Just for the cultivation of beauty itself. This thing will not be productive in any sense, it will just be an exploration into what can be. There won’t be a productive aspect _per-se_ of this whole thing, but it will be just an exploration of beauty. Just creating for the sake of it.\n\nIn parallel, what is going to be built in different places of the world are bigger retreat centers, on which people will be able to come and go deep into their practice. The first one will be built in Chile, and it will open its doors as a place of deep exploration within, and a strong fostering of the consequences of that exploration that comes from fostering the creative aspect of every one that will be part of one of the retreats.\n\nThe mission of Dukkha is to help you go deep within, so that you can connect to the source of creative action in there, and from that transform the way on which you experience reality by being able to express everything of who you are through your own creation. Each and every one of us is an individual human being, each having something particular to add to this world. Dukkha is about opening that window, and letting it open forever so that we can thrive with the magic of what it means to be alive. Human beings are the means by which God creates stuff in this material realm. It is time to start Doing The Work, to realize that and start creating cool stuff.\n\n—\n\nThe meditations are getting deeper and deeper, and there is a sensation present that I’m beginning to realize how it is to just let go of the letting go. It is connected to the full acceptance of what is present. I went away a lot of times, thinking, or witnessing the thoughts, I don’t really know, it is hard to differentiate, but what was present was a sense of acceptance of that process. I was being aware that I had gone, and I was not judging myself in the process. Instead, I kept asking myself: Who is the one that is thinking those thoughts? And that helped a lot during the process. It helped me to realize that there is not ‘right’ way of doing this thing, there is only doing it. It is what my teacher told me a while ago, when we were talking about what a good meditation is. It is one that happens. Every day that you sit in the cushion you some kind of progress in the realization of your own nature, on the understanding of your own mind. Each step is a step that goes towards this understanding in a way that is not predictable, because each time is new. That is why Socrates said ‘I only know that I don’t know’, because the most wise way of approaching life is with the beginners mind, realizing that every moment, every second is a new opportunity to witness what unfolds in front of your experience. It is always a new discovery. For me, for example, as I write these words, it is a new discovery each time that a word is written. I truly don’t know what will come out, and I don’t really care. I just write, and become surprised by what happens.\n\nToday is a big day in that regard, because until now I haven’t been able to polish my work. I had just written everything that came, and left it there, unresolved, unfinished. I have a strong tendency inside me to not finish properly what I started and today is the day on which I acknowledge that and transform it into a new way of doing things. I proposed myself to organize my 4 hours of deep work of today with 3 of them being the vomit of words and 1 of them being the reading and polishing of what was written. Only then I will feel that it is something that I could say is complete. That is what I have been missing to openly share this work with the world. It is very interesting, because I have shared a lot of my work openly, and I don’t really care about it being how it is. I just share it. But in this moment I’m realizing that the biggest aspect of me not trusting it is not about sharing it, is about polishing it. Making it really good. At least consuming it myself. Every time that I have done a podcast, I just publish it, and never listen to it again. Or when I record a video, I just publish it, and never see it. Or when I write a piece of my blog, I often just publish it, without too much reading and polishing. That is because I don’t trust my work enough, I don’t love myself and my creations enough for putting everything of what I am behind it and really be caring about what I do. It is just a vomiting of stuff. And the world sees you as you see yourself. How do I want my work to be appreciated if I don’t even appreciate it enough to read it and polish it? I can’t expect that. And this is the moment on which I realize it. That’s why writing has been so powerful for me, because as I write down whatever comes to mind I end up realizing important things that are going on inside me, important traits of the person that I have been and the person that I want to be. It is just about caring enough to be that person. Caring enough about myself. Trusting enough about what I do. This is a huge thing. I feel a strong sense of peace inside after having realized this.\n\nThat’s how the whole thing works. You sit down, you Do The Work, and let it be the means by which you dive deeper into the exploration of yourself. I just ended my meditation, and the last 10 minutes were a nightmare. I really suffered with them, there were a lot of things going on in my being that were uncomfortable, and there was a burning desire to give up and go out of it. But those are the moments that teach you the most, the most important ones, and it is very important to continue being part of them, continue pushing through. Always have in mind: This shall pass too. Everything shall pass. But what you learned by going through it will stay with you forever, there is no way of taking it away. What I just realized related to the care that I put into my work and how it expresses by me not being willing to consume it and polish it, will ever stay there. That is the means by which I evolve in my craft. There is no one that can come and tell me what I’m doing right or wrong. I mean, there can be teachers that give you the particular pointers that will make you not suck at what you do, but at the end of the day you have to go into the trenches and realize by yourself which are your own particular biases, your own particular ways of doing the thing, so that you can become accustomed to them and work your way in through them. The only way in is through. That plays its role in every aspect of life. It is always present.\n\nThat’s why I invite you, dear reader, to define in which realm of action you will start Doing The Work. It doesn’t need to be anything particular, just try out something and if it doesn’t work change. It doesn’t matter. Give yourself the opportunity to explore, to make mistakes, to grow. As you go through each iteration you will learn better what works for you and what doesn’t, and that will give you a deeper understanding of yourself. That is the whole game in here: getting to know yourself. And there is no better means to do that than sitting down to be a witness of what is going on in meditation, and then transforming those insights into a creative act. You decide which one it will be, but give yourself the permission to be consistent with it. Stick with it, and put your heart and soul into it. It doesn’t matter how good it is, because what is usually accounted for good is just a consequence of the amount of time that you have accumulated doing that particular thing.\n\nBut in this world, there are no good or bad, there is just doing it because time is an invention of the mind. So comparing something as good or bad is also an invention of the mind. The only thing that matters here, is the amount of presence that is transmitted into the object of your creation. The more present you are as you are doing it, the deeper will be the imprint that it will have from all of what you truly are. That is everything that we need here. Don’t care about it being good or bad, we are trying to get rid of those polarities. Transcend the polarity by just Doing The Work. Sit down and just do it.\n\nOpen up to a complete transformation of yourself in the process, as you go deeper and deeper into the layers of what takes you out of the trance, or flow on which you will enter. If you are in it and you start thinking about the lunch that you are going to each tomorrow, acknowledge that you are thinking about that, smile deeply about how crazy the mind is, and go back to where you were before. It is just like that, every time acknowledging what is already there (in this case, that you were thinking about your lunch), and moving on with what was happening before. This ends up being a game, not one of chasing after thoughts, but one of just accepting what is there. It is the ongoing process of just being aware of what is there. Letting it be, and focusing on your thing.\n\nAlways remember: Give yourself the space for what you would categorize as doing it wrong. ‘I got lost in thought and ended up staring at the blank space’. That’s perfect, as long as you are still doing the thing. Even if you grab your phone and end up answering to an email, it is ok. As soon as you recognize that you are doing that, remember that you were Doing The Work, go back to it, and continue with what you were doing before. This will train your whole system in a way that I don’t completely understand, but I know it works, because I’m going through that same process as I write this book. Each time that I sit down to do it gets more enjoyable, and the burden of not doing it correctly is dissolving itself in the waters of equanimity. In the space of acceptance of everything that is.\n\nI used to blame myself for being eating as I was standing up, for example. Or by feeling anger when I saw my father. Or whatever. My mind is very tricky. But now I realize that all of that blaming was just a consequence of me doing something different from what I should. There was always this ‘shouldding’ present, talking to me on the back of my head, and telling me that I was not good enough. ‘You are not healthy enough because you are eating as you are standing up’. ‘You are a bad person because you feel anger towards your father’, etc. Always that little voice in the background making its noise. But now I know that I’m moving towards a deep understanding that that voice will probably never go away. I’m evolving my relationship with that voice in a way that makes me feel free. Because every time that I realize that I’m caught in those thoughts or feelings, I acknowledge it, and come back to what I was doing before. Or I just go deep into the thoughts or feelings, without caring too much if it is what ‘should’ be or not. It is just what is. And that acceptance is everything. It truly is. I hope that you are able to start experiencing your reality from there, because I also want you to be free. If I’m able to help in any way in that mission, I feel grateful and happy. Thank you for opening me this window.\n\nHoly shit, I feel that it has been a very important session and day. I feel lighter. How do you feel? Who is the one that is feeling how you feel? I invite you to ask yourself that question, over and over, until there is no one asking it. You will begin to ask yourself: ‘Am I crazy that I have all this chattering going on inside myself?’. Congratulations, you are a step ahead into the journey of becoming a more conscious human being. You are beginning to be aware that you are thinking, that you are experiencing life, and that is what you need to do in order to have a better relationship with yourself and the stuff that you do. You will probably begin to ask yourself questions like this often. You will find yourself asking yourself: Who is the one that is inside there? I want to let you know that you are not the only crazy one. At least each person that will read this will start exploring into that inquiry, and we will all become crazy on our own way. It is said that it is no degree of sanity to be used to an insane society.\n\nI guess that the way on which that insane society transforms itself into a sane one is by each of us becoming a little bit crazy, or at least each of us acknowledging the crazy part of ourself that is very deep inside us. The unconscious mind is very wicked, exotic, pathological and yes… Crazy. And as soon as we acknowledge that and start making all what is in there conscious, we will start to know ourselves more and more, and the consequence of that will be a freeing up of space for becoming more of what we truly are. Not the noise that is present inside because of all the experiences that we have gone through in our lifetime. Nope, that is just the noise that won’t let yourself shine through it. By making the unconscious conscious you free up the space for that noise to go away, for the pond to become quieter and quieter, and with that, you open up the space for just being. That is what you came here to do: Just be. Everything that you have ever been, through that body, through those eyes, with that voice. Just be that. Give us the gift of experiencing you as a creative force, as a slope of water that comes from the source from which everything arises. Just give yourself that space, and open up to what will arise. Be amazed by it. You will never know, you can’t know, because it is something that manifests itself as it goes.\n\nLife manifests itself as it goes down the road. You cannot predict what will be born from your creative endeavors in 2 years, because it will be a consequence and a gathering of everything that will happen in these 2 years (and everything that has happened before) filtered by the amount of presence that you are able to bring into that creative act. That is the amazing part, and that is what is filled with wonder about this whole game of being alive. We don’t really know how things are going to look like, and it is fucking amazing that way. Open up for that possibility, of being a witness of your own transformation, and start Doing The Work. The sooner you start, the sooner you will realize how much it will transform you. The only thing that you need is consistency, is showing up, and that is free.\n\nThe future is free. Each one of us has the opportunity of being consistent in any particular domain, and that will pay off. That will bring about what you need to experience to grow, to evolve. To be transformed. The sole act of being consistent speaks about an amount of love that is expressed through actions that is very powerful, because you are showing up for something that you don’t know how it will end up. You are trusting, and it is an act of faith. You don’t know what will come out of it, but if you trust, something cool will. That is the game that we are playing. That is the adventure that we are beginning to explore in this day and age, on which the whole world is realizing the importance of doing creative work. In business, more and more creatives are entering new companies because their view of life is what is needed for being a business that is able to evolve fast with the demands of the market. As I have been talking about before, being a creative is surrendering into what can come, without controlling it. It is about being a witness of what shows up, and developing the internal means for being there when that happens.\n\nIt is about being a master of transforming reality, as it is. Remember: Always as it is. This involves developing the capacity for being present. For being there, when things are happening, as they are happening. For becoming one with what is happening, so that you can interpret it without your mind, and explore what to do from a place different than the one from which thoughts arise. This is a level of intelligence that is closely related to the one of nature, and it is the higher level of intelligence. Presence is the highest form of intelligence, and it expresses itself through the creation of reality when it is not mediated by the mind. The mind is the servant. The master is presence. That is the killer combination, through which true genius arise. And every one of us has that level of intelligence available, it is not related to being good at math or at language or whatever. As I said before, all of those ‘levels of intelligence’ are a consequence of your life experience. The capacity for being present, the capacity for being aware, is always there, no matter what your life story is. You don’t need to be a monk, or a very special human being, to go into that rabbit hole. Nope. What you need is just the openness to be present to what is, and the compassion with yourself to give you the permission to not do it. To forget. But always remember. Go back to the breath as an anchor into the present moment and remember. You are aware. You are here. You were doing something. Put your whole heart in it. That’s how this game is played. We came here to have fun. We came here to create. We came here to polish every second the understanding of who we are, so that we can have the wisdom to give up everything of what we think we are and just be. Give yourself the permission to just be. You will enjoy it more than anything in your life, because it is the expression of life itself, running through your veins, looking out from your eyes, listening through your ears, touching with your skin, being aware of awareness.\n\nOpen up to the possibility of living life at its fullest. This is the most amazing gift that we have been given, and each moment is a new opportunity to learn how to live more present. Or, as I wrote yesterday, to forget how to live in the illusion of time. There is not right or wrong… There just is.\n",

A big aspect of being part of the community is to open up a space in their own town to Do The Work, so that they can spread the word locally. So we start online, we keep doing online TJ so that we can get the full power that is needed to spread the word in the offline world. The process of awakening will happen in a collective scale, and the people that are in charge of taking care of these places (that I have called nodes) in every part of the world are the keepers of wisdom. As the DAO grows, there will be the opportunity for funding these places, that I envision as small huts where people can go in and have an intense experience of transformation, especially with psychedelics. I don\\u2019t imagine it is a center where people can gather, that will be online, but it will be a place where one person goes to have a particular intense experience. This enables it to be built in the backyard of the keeper of wisdom, which makes it much more probable to happen. This node is envisioned as a place of exploration, and as a spaceship of the future. We have spent so much energy trying to reach for mars as a species, but the most important journey that we need to undertake is the one within.

It is what my teacher told me a while ago, when we were talking about what a good meditation is. It is one that happens. Every day that you sit in the cushion you some kind of progress in the realization of your own nature, on the understanding of your own mind. Each step is a step that goes towards this understanding in a way that is not predictable, because each time is new.

I proposed myself to organize my 4 hours of deep work of today with 3 of them being the vomit of words and 1 of them being the reading and polishing of what was written. Only then I will feel that it is something that I could say is complete. That is what I have been missing to openly share this work with the world. It is very interesting, because I have shared a lot of my work openly, and I don\\u2019t really care about it being how it is. I just share it. But in this moment I\\u2019m realizing that the biggest aspect of me not trusting it is not about sharing it, is about polishing it. Making it really good. At least consuming it myself. Every time that I have done a podcast, I just publish it, and never listen to it again. Or when I record a video, I just publish it, and never see it. Or when I write a piece of my blog, I often just publish it, without too much reading and polishing. That is because I don\\u2019t trust my work enough, I don\\u2019t love myself and my creations enough for putting everything of what I am behind it and really be caring about what I do. It is just a vomiting of stuff. And the world sees you as you see yourself. How do I want my work to be appreciated if I don\\u2019t even appreciate it enough to read it and polish it? I can\\u2019t expect that. And this is the moment on which I realize it. That\\u2019s why writing has been so powerful for me, because as I write down whatever comes to mind I end up realizing important things that are going on inside me, important traits of the person that I have been and the person that I want to be.

I mean, there can be teachers that give you the particular pointers that will make you not suck at what you do, but at the end of the day you have to go into the trenches and realize by yourself which are your own particular biases, your own particular ways of doing the thing, so that you can become accustomed to them and work your way in through them.

We came here to have fun. We came here to create. We came here to polish every second the understanding of who we are, so that we can have the wisdom to give up everything of what we think we are and just be. Give yourself the permission to just be.

          "raw": "\nFacing a blank page is brutal. There is a feeling inside present as if there was nothing to be said, nothing worth your time as a reader, and a lot of doubts about the process. Am I bringing myself into another void inside my own mind? Is this another way on which I trick myself, imposing me a strict thing to do so that I can be busy on that and not completely present? It is quite a challenge not to become like a robot, even doing this kind of work that is very much connected to my heart. There is that sensation of it being like ‘something that needs to be done’, and that is the one that I will have in mind as the information that I need to make some progress in my understanding of myself.\n\nThe last year specifically I dove into a very deep and consistent yoga practice, with the clear intention of evolving my relationship with myself, and it was always hard for me to deal with each class as a ritual. As something that was going to capture the attention of every part of me. I just went for it, I just did it, and a lot of the times it ended up being something mechanic. I hate to say it, because it is hard for me to deal with it. I knew that I did not want it to be mechanic, but I also realized as I was doing it that I was not succeeding too much in that effort. It seemed very hard for me to fully experience each class, not thinking that I was doing something on the long term, and that it was something like a stepping stone towards a particular goal. The goal? It doesn’t really matter, the important part is how my consciousness is set apart from what is going on in the moment because of a fixation on the consequences that what is being done will have in the future.\n\nAs I sit down and write these words, there is something shown related to that. I do my thing, end up sitting down and establish the relationship with my work so that I can start. What are the things that surround this experience of sitting down to write that give it the meaning that can produce this feeling of ‘not just doing it because it is what needs to be done’, but doing it because I care? Because there is a deep feeling inside me that one day these words will be read by someone, and that person will find a particular resonance in them that will help her in any way. That is the aim of what is being written, but as the whole process of writing is established there is no clarity related to this being the ‘correct way’ to do it.\n\nAnd there we go back to the correct way. There is no correct, there just is. But the thing that makes noise in my mind is: Am I just pointing myself and everyone that reads into a direction that is not good for them? I hope not, but it is hard to stop it now. I already created this frame of action for myself and as a help for you so it is time to embrace it and realize that there nothing more important that I should be doing than this. And the word good is there present again, making its announcement that there is something that needs to be compared to. Would it be better to be doing something else? That is part of the shoulds that we are trying to light in here, trying to make them conscious.\n\nThere is a lot of sleepiness going on inside here. When going up from the bed there was a deep and intense craving for having more sleep, for giving myself the permission to sleep a lot more. That’s what I will go and do. Sleep a little bit more. This is the moment on which I stand and give myself the permission to be as not as disciplined as I could be because there is a need that my body is expressing to me that needs to be fulfilled. This kind of relationship is something that I’m learning to deal with, because it would be easy to just stay here and push through it, but my mind tells me all these stories about it wanting to rest. Should I stay or should I go. That is the big question. The bed is cozy and warm, but all the stories of success that have been heard involve pushing through times like this, being resilient in the face of what shows up. But going there will be more information to myself, because I will realize what it brings to actually give up that unconditional discipline and just give me the space to sleep. I’m not giving up, I’m just taking care of myself.\n\n(…)\n\nSo yes, I went there to sleep for an hour and it was hard to do it. The mind was there, making its noise. I arrived to the bed and there was no more sleepiness and I was like: Really? And now I’m here and it is back an everything is weird and it is tough. I arrived to the bed and my little baby was there and I was like why am I doing this whole thing, why always taking the hardest road possible? Is this really what should be done in this moment? That is why all this thing is being built, because the suffering is just too much, the inability to be grateful for what is and not expect something different is too much, I’m tired of it and I want to get out of this maze and this is the way that my heart is telling me but it is very hard because I don’t know how to make the progress that I need to make in order to feel good and my mind is telling me that I’m alone in this thing but it is not like that because yesterday I had an amazing call with a friend that truly cares about me and she is truly guiding me in this path so I’m not alone, those are only stories that are told inside, but they are not part of the reality.\n\nThis is an important moment, and I’m doing what I’m doing to help. It is the most that I could do after everything that has happened in my life. But yes. Am I building another nightmare for myself on which I impose to me that I have to show up in order to evolve or is it truly what I need to do? The mind, more and more, running around with its noise. Always that noise making its appearance. It is never never never enough. Where is the trust? Where is the acknowledgment that what I’m putting out to the universe will be rewarded in any way? Am I doing it because there will be a reward? Am I unconsciously looking for that love that I have discovered is what my soul craves for? Is this my way of seeking love from the universe? It seems like a new way that I have discovered it. A new system. I build for myself love systems, which aim for me to feel love. I’m desperate for that love.\n\n—\n\nThere is something that I have been doing this past time sometimes and now it is the moment for me to better realize what it is about, and why I have added all this noise. So I go through my morning meditation, and I decided that I want to share it with the world so that more people can meditate. But just adds more noise into the thing because I’m openly recording myself to broadcast to absolutely no one in YouTube, and I’m bringing in what comes after doing that. Today was the editing of the video for publishing, so that afterwards I could check out how it was recorded to realize that it was not of good quality at all. It was just noise. And I keep doing this kind of things, sharing myself as noise, because of not being able to polish my stuff enough.\n\nI think that this transition that I’m doing to share my voice with the world needs to take into account all these live streams that I have done, and all this sharings with the internet of those videos. Is it worth it to broadcast a video that no one will ever watch? Where am I going with that?\n\nDo people really need to sit down to meditate with me like that? I don’t think that that is what my audience wants/needs, but the problem is that I don’t even know who my audience is. Who keeps coming is depressed people, but are they the ones that will go on and stay with that horrible YouTube video with bad audio for one hour? Why would they do that instead of just shutting down their computer and doing it on their own? It makes much more sense that way. And I don’t want to force anything, but I have this like constant craving to share everything that I do, and all of what I am with the world. I share my breathwork practice so that people can see that I Do The Work. I want them to acknowledge that, and to be witness so that they can be inspired by it.\n\nBut that is not what people want. It is just a matter to see the response that I have got from what I have done. There are always 0 persons watching the streams, and the tweets that I put up have very few responses. It is always me trying to force something in people that they don’t really want, and I’m wasting all my energy in that. Even writing this book, is it something that people really want? Am I writing for someone or am I just writing for myself? It seems that I’m writing just for myself. That everything that I have done is for myself. The Open Source Factory? It was just for myself, running around in circles, inside the maze of my own mind. I’m writing to make sense. That is really what I’m doing. Making sense of all this thing that is happening through me. And how can I explain it better than just writing like this? It is what comes up more naturally, with less friction. I could be directing my speech towards a particular person, but it is hard for me to do it that way. I really don’t know how to do it. I just want to express what is inside me, and the most natural way of doing it is just creating this flow of words that comes out as what you are reading.\n\nI know that it is better to write as if you were talking to a specific person, but for me it doesn’t work that way. And I know that it has an impact like this, because there is people that have read it and have found value on what I have done. That is the thing, trusting enough in what you have to offer so that people can find that value from there. I trust what I’m doing, and because of that, I write it the way it comes. That is how I do my thing, and the problem that I have is that I don’t have a particular audience that knows that I exist. I have not done my due diligence properly, and that has me in a place of writing into the void, just throwing stuff out there without making too much sense of it. It is very hard for me to communicate what I have inside in a way that makes sense to people. I create websites and they are not understood. I create gatherings and no one shows up. There is obviously something that I’m not doing properly, there is a lack of connection between me and the people that I want to reach out, and that lack of connection is what determines how alone I am in what I do. But the thing is… Do I want to be connected to them truly? Do I want to listen to what they have to say? Or I’m just in my track of thought here, as always, thinking that my truth is the only truth?\n\nAnd the big problem related to this is that I have managed to find out THE truth to strive for. Like the ultimate truth of them all, the truth of our existence as human beings. So what is that about? How can I reach out to people while I hold this truth as the means by which I interact with them?\n\nThe answer pops up as obvious: The truth is just each truth that exists. There are as many truths as human beings.\n\nI need to take care of them. I need to hold the space for their evolution. I need to be truly interested by them, so that I can grow with the understanding of their world. I need to engage in conversations, to participate in communities, to share my voice. To ask questions. That is what I like doing the most… Asking questions. I need to do that more often, because on the last days I have only taken care of what I do, my side of the thing. What I publish. My content. My writing. And that is not how it works in this world anymore. What I need to do is create a compelling profile and start interacting more with people. Start asking questions. I will set up a goal of 10 questions every day. Show up with curiosity, with wonder, and grow in that sense. That is my mission, and each question that I ask will open the window for that person to come to my profile and be interested by what I do there. That, and only that, is what is going to help me grow and create an audience for myself. Before I went away for travelling I was doing it consistently, and then I stopped because I did not have internet, but now I have to come back to it. Not because of the growth of the thing, but because I really need it. I need to challenge myself in the arena, in the place where people interact, in the place where the stuff is going on. I feed myself in conversations with other people, and as long as I do that consistently I will learn better how to grow as a human being in this modern age.\n\nIt is important that I care enough about how I share myself to the world so that I don’t publish all that shitty videos that speak about who I am, but in a manner that is not proper for a good understanding of it. Even from myself. How you see you is how they see you. I see me in those videos as a person that doesn’t take into account how he looks, and that is the message that I’m broadcasting to the world. Because when I sit down to meditate for 1 hour broadcasting it in youtube it is powerful for me, but for the viewer it is shitty. It doesn’t speak quality, and it doesn’t matter how much quality there is in my meditation process. The important part is how people see the message that is conveyed through how I present myself to the world, and it is important to take that into account so that I can grow what I do into something that people will care about.\n\nI can see now that this is a pattern of behavior that has been present throughout my life. When I used to go out more, and party a lot, I didn’t care about how I looked really. I always weared the same clothes, and for me it was ok like that. It was not something that I invested time or energy in. And now I have the same problem, because conveying my message depends on me being able to be clear and concise, and present myself in a way that is appealing to the other person. And I’m not having that impact, at least that is the feeling that I have related to the situations that I put myself in. But I guess that what is showing up as I write this is that I don’t need to be the one that creates those kinds of things, at least not now. It is not the time. I don’t have to invest time and energy in building those kind of things because it is a waste right now. If I create an online meditation and no one shows up, it is because of something. If I create a breathwork session and the only two people that show up are my wife and my best friend, maybe it is because I don’t have enough trust from the people that are being part of the network, and because of that, I don’t have their attention. Trust and attention, that is the game, and I have not been playing it correctly. I’m building this whole thing as a enormous maze, and perhaps I’m jumping over some steps. Because right now I’m working with the breath, I’m training to be a breathwork facilitator, and that is the step that comes at this stage of the journey.\n\nI know the road that lies ahead, but it is important to stay quiet with it. How is my breathwork practice going to be impacted because of me doing the thing that I do? What if I start making one good quality video each week so that I can start building an audience with that and actually adding value? And I say I will write a book and I spend all this time writing the book but I think: Is it really adding value to someone? How is this thing making an impact in the world?\n\nBut yes, the doors open from me doing this, there is a deeper understanding of myself as I open up to write a bit more, and perharps that is what I need to make progress. Be able to distill the parts of it that are more appealing into stuff that I can share in different places, and with that, start growing. Start building who I am on the internet. Step by step, but being intelligent. I need to be intelligent, and I haven’t been until now, because I’m throwing an infinite amount of puches to kill my enemy, but it will never work like that. There needs to be a tactical approach to this growth, to this way of doing things, and that is what is being discovered in this writing.\n\nI know that my craft is writing, and I know that the way on which I hone my craft is by sitting down and writing for 4 hours every day. That is the commitment that I did with myself, so that I could bring out of me what needs to be brought out. That is my challenge. To show up and Do The Work every day, to realize what comes, and to explore from there. I owe that to myself, because this is an amazing way that I have for thinking. I have to be sincere. I truly have to be sincere with this thing. Writing is the way on which I think, and opening up the window of the unconscious by letting it all out is just the means by which I’m able to better connect with myself and with who I am.\n\nAnd I need to think these thoughts, and need to have these realizations, because of everything that I’m going through. I know that my daughter will read these words one day and realize that this was the moment in my life when something big was happening. And besides everything that could be going on in any place of my being, this is the moment on which I decided to write my first book. Holy shit, my first book. I have always thought as myself as a writer, and this is the first time that I actually embody it in a way that makes sense. It is the first time that I commit to do the work enough so that a body of work like this can be produced. I need to honor it. I need to honor this commitment. I have been showing up for 16 days until now, every day Doing The Work, and it is time for me to acknowledge that. Holy shit, it is a lot.\n\nAnd what comes also is the recognition that this is the beginning of a journey. It is the journey of being able to express who I am and what I care about through words. The big commitment of being open to be whatever I decide to be. Of being myself. Of just being myself. Writing my first book is opening myself to that commitment, and realizing that there is a world of opportunities ahead. Is it a good idea to publish it as a book and not a paywalled Substack post every week? Does it even matter? Nope, it doesn’t matter because I can do both. Part of what is being written here can be translated into a blog post, and I can start building my content around this whole journey of discovery of who I am.\n\n——\n\nI will never know how my creations will look like in the future, I never know what is going to be written in the next line, and that is a great opportunity for exploration. In this moment there is a certain feeling of unsatisfactoriness inside me related to the way that I am writing, and a expectation that in the future, as I go deeper in the craft, that feeling will become something way more expansive, way more connected to my heart. But for now it is the way it is because I’m not fully open in this moment, and it is ok like that. I acknowledge it, I feel it completely, and I move on from there. It is part of the game. I’m beginning to get used to what this thing is about. I remember in the book The War On Art when Steven talks to his neighbor about finally finishing a book, and he answered back: So when are you going to start the next one?\n\nThis is an ongoing process, that is just getting started. This first book is only the beginning of something new, something different, a new way of being, a new way of creating. I will acknowledge every thought, sensation and feeling that is present because it is all what is now, and one day it will be extremely value to come back and read the maze of words that I have written today and tell myself: That is who you are. These were the troubles that I was having in that moment to share my voice. To make sense of what was coming so that I could write something that makes sense. I will hold this words with respect and pride, because they are the ones that are helping me become who I will be in the next moment. I hope that they become an inspiration for you also because there is nothing like just being, without caring too much about what happens at the other side. There is nothing like just sharing your creative voice and letting it shine through your object of creation. May it be anything, but just let it flow. Let it be there, let it be manifested, translated from the depths of your being into this reality so that we can all enjoy it and share what doing it brought into your life. That is the game that we are going to start to play more and more, as people are able to open up to what is at the other side of being curious for what you have to offer. For what you can create- For how crazy you are.\n\nBe open to be the craziest person in the room, please. We need it. It is the best gift that you can give us. And your children will also appreciate it, they want you to be crazy. They want to experience you completely.\n\n—\n\nToday I came walking to the office walking through the garden of my grandmother, and she has a lot of tress and plats that are in the flowering stage. I was walking a bit in a hurry, and then I realized that and started walking slowly, sinking in what was going in around me. The amazing expression of beauty that is produced in spring, as each flower makes its way through the air to reach out for the sun and open up their heart to what is there. Each flower was a different experience, on a different point of their development, and each with its own story. I realized the importance of slowing down and just be a witness of nature, of what was going on there. Of the harmony between bugs, snails, raindrops, sunlight, everything. Being able to appreciate the place where I live and be open to receive everything that it offers is something that I need to remind me about every day, because it is very easy for me to forget it and take it for granted.\n\nHow much of what you have in your life you take for granted? How much do you take life for granted? As soon as you go back and start to realize the amount of miracles that needed to happen so that you could be here, what starts coming is a deep appreciation of what is. Or at least the willingness to walk that way. As I wrote that my mother came into mind, and the incapacity that I have had in the last weeks to connect with her in a deeper level. Is it that I take her for granted that I’m not able to give her what she needs from her son? What am I not seeing that makes me take her for granted? She is the one that gave me life, and it is time for me to realize that and be grateful for it.\n\nThe consequence of realizing that you take something for granted is gratitude for it being part of your life. It is an appreciation for it being there. What was the last element of your life that you took for granted and you lost? How has that teached you about who you are?\n\nBut that is the eternal mystery of being alive. You don’t know what you have until it is not there anymore. That is the theme that repeats itself over and over, and there doesn’t seem to be a clear understanding of how to go through that process. How to not take things for granted. And the answer to this that comes right now is that the way is being present. By being present, you embrace what is with everything that is there, you sink it in completely. It becomes part of who you are in a way that is not filtered by the mind, and that creates a flow of energy that is ever present in you and translates itself into gratitude.\n\nIt feels like I’m just talking nonsense here. I’m trying to organize my thoughts in a way that is conducing to create something that has any kind of value to you, dear reader, but it is not coming through. I guess that it is a good moment for offering ourselves a space of silence, of contemplation. Of witnessing what is present in our life that we take for granted. If you didn’t take it for granted, how would your relationship to it evolve? How would it be different?\n\n(…)\n\nThe word that better describes this whole proces is unleashing. It is as if there was a small bird hatching out from the egg that has given it the possibility to exist, and each word that is being written is a small crack in the egg so that the resistance is broken. Or maybe that is not a good way of putting it, because what will happen with resistance is not that it is going to be broken, it is going to be understood. Dealt with. I know from the masters that it will always be there, it is part of life, but it won’t be in the driver’s seat. It will be there, making its noise, doing its thing, but being helpful for what is wanting to be achieved. For what is being created. Let resistance be the force behind the actions, because it is what speaks to me about an avenue that needs to be explored. As soon as there is some resistance present, there is an opportunity to show up and inquiry into the information that it is bringing me about myself. Every circumstance is a window into a deeper knowing of who you are. Always have that in mind. Everything that you go through, every moment of your life can be the means by which you deepen your connection with yourself, just by being a witness of how you react to it.\n\nLet this be a continual process. It is not that you will read this and start realizing how everything that you go through impacts you and the information that it gives you, but have it as a pointer. As something that is present in your mind. Probably in most circumstances you won’t even remember this, but as you go through the process of Doing The Work, you’ll start to become more aware, you’ll start to catch these glimpses of clarity on which you’ll say: So this is what he was meaning when he was talking about the resistance. For example, each time that you have a conscious relationship with what the word procastination means, inquiry into what you are avoiding by not sitting down to Do The Work. I’m going through that myself now, as I take more and more time to continue writing these lines. I realize how harmful that is for the whole process, because there is a thread that is lost. I knew what I was talking about, I was giving it all my energy, and now it is kind of lost.\n\nSo what am I avoiding by not being focused in here?\n\nWhat comes up when I realize that I don’t have a particular clue about what to write. Yesterday was an important day, I started sharing my work publicly with an opportunity to buy the book. This means that I have commited to do this for the next months, and it feels scary. I felt like an imposter, charging money for something that is not even complete. I have written for 16 days, but who tells me that I will be able to do it for the rest of them? Will I have something to write about? Will I be running in circles and repeating the same things over and over again? Who knows, but the thing is that the people that sign up for this journey know that beforehand. I told them that this is not ready, and the rules. And they signed up for them, because they trust me.\n\nThey trust what I can be, and what can be created through me. It doesn’t really matter what it is, the important thing is that it is. But I’m avoiding those feelings of a failure by procastinating, because that has been everything that I have done always. Pushing me down and making me think that I’m not enough. That I’m not worthy of attention. And I think that those sensations will never go away, because it is part of how my ego defends me. I always remember that story about a famous singer that each time that he went into stage vomited. He was scared as hell. But he still showed up. That is what I’m teaching myself to do here, just to show up, with whatever I am, with whatever I come up with.\n\nAnd my mission in that process it to help you realize that you can do the same. There is nothing special in myself that tells that I’m a person that can do this kind of thing. That is what we have gotten wrong about creativity. Society thinks that it is about inspiration. It is not. It is about just sitting down and Doing The Work. Being consistent about it. Caring about it. That is everything that matters, because the results will compound over time and you won’t even realize when your body of work will speak for itself.\n\nThat is the magic of it. It is accessible to us all. There is no special pill, or special thing that makes one person more readily available for being creative. Yes, there are some people that can afford more of it because they have better life circumstances, but in this world we are having more and more opportunities to Do The Work, no matter how much time it is. If you don’t have enough, just start for 30 minutes every day. Just be consistent with it, and be open to the transformation that will happen within yourself. If you are reading this, I invite you to devote 30 minutes every day to create something that didn’t exist before. I repeat: It doesn’t matter what it is. Just do it. Open up to a better understanding of who you are by doing it.\n\nWe have been trained to think that this is not the way, because in schools they used to give us grades for how good our work was. This builds up a notion of comparison that is what ends up being the way on which we value creative work. We think that something is ‘better’ than another thing, as if there was a fundamental measurement device that commanded the whole thing. It doesn’t matter anymore. What matters is the heart that you put in the thing. The amount of presence that you bring into what you are creating. Because it is not about who will receive what you create, it is about how transformed you are throughout the process.\nThe world will receive it from there. That will be the impact that it will have, because the fact that you are a different person after facing the void of creating from nowhere definetly has an impact in the world. You may not be able to notice it directly, but it will. At least you will have something new to talk about. Do you remember how you felt when you talked about that time that you did something for 10 days in a row? Do you know how it feels to do it for 100? Show up for yourself, and realize it on your own experience. Nothing that any person says can be translated into your own experience, because what comes up is different for each one of us.\n\nWe all have our different demons, our different patterns of action, our different ways of existing, and it is important to let all of those arise just for yourself. No one can do that work for you. It is for you to witness, and for you to better understand where you are coming from when you act. The biggest present that you can do to yourself in this lifetime is dive deep into who you are, into the understanding of everything that you are, so that you can experience life from that understanding. It truly is a gift, and as you start travelling that path you are transformed.\n\nTalking about addictions, I think that this is one of the most intense ones that you can have. That craving to go deeper, to get to know yourself better. Do you remember that kid that was staring back at you in the mirror when you were a young? Do you remember those experiences that traumatized you when you were growing? Do you remember all those happy moments on which your heart didn’t fill in your chest? There is a common denominator in all of those experiences: YOU. You have always been present in all your life, and all of the circumstances that you have gone through converge into what you are right now, as you read these words.\n\nI invite you to inquire deeper into that concept of you that you have within, and ask you: Who is the one that feels represented? Who is the one that has been with me throughout this lifetime? Ask yourself these questions until there is no doubt. Close your eyes and witness what comes up. Those memories, the sensations and feelings associated with those memories. What is present in your body right now. Open up to what is present, right here, right now. Open up to the truth of being, which is that the only thing that is real is what is happening now. That is the truth. And it is a mystery that lies deep within each one of us. This book is an invitation to navigate that mystery together.\n\n—\n\nI want to talk a bit now about the role that psychedelics play in this whole game. I see them as atomic bombs to the self structure, that tear each piece apart in a way that is absolutely different than anything that you have experienced before. They are major pointers, that let you know the way to move towards. If you don’t have any experience with them, or with meditation, or with anything, probably most aspects of what I have been talking about may seem alien to you. I may be talking nosense.\n\nAnd that’s where the leap of faith needs to come from, because I truly know where I’m talking from. I’ve been there. I know that there is something fundamentally different to our existence as human beings that what we have been used to, and psychedelics open up the window into that realm in a way that is more efficient than anything else. And that is what is needed right now. A shattering of the structures that have been in place, so that we can build more conscious ones. More connected with the essence of who we truly are. More connected to what we came here to do.\n\nIt is not about transforming ourselves into something different from what we are, it is about evolving ourselves into what we have always been. Psychedelics show us the road. They are not the road per se, the main thesis of this book is that the way is a perpetual exploration into the self by tools that are part of yourself in every moment, mainly meditation, breathing and creativity, but for those changes to take place there needs to be a shift that may be catalyzed by an atomic bomb. Maybe that is the nuclear war that every one is talking about. It is time to nuke ourselves without mercy, to see what stays afterwards. I’ve been there, and there is nothing more freeing than surrendering to everything that just is. I’m here to hold your hand as you go through the same and tell you: It’s all going to be ok.\n",

That is my mission, and each question that I ask will open the window for that person to come to my profile and be interested by what I do there.

For example, each time that you have a conscious relationship with what the word procastination means, inquiry into what you are avoiding by not sitting down to Do The Work. I\\u2019m going through that myself now, as I take more and more time to continue writing these lines. I realize how harmful that is for the whole process, because there is a thread that is lost.

I felt like an imposter, charging money for something that is not even complete. I have written for 16 days, but who tells me that I will be able to do it for the rest of them? Will I have something to write about? Will I be running in circles and repeating the same things over and over again?

It doesn\\u2019t really matter what it is, the important thing is that it is.

That I\\u2019m not worthy of attention. And I think that those sensations will never go away, because it is part of how my ego defends me. I always remember that story about a famous singer that each time that he went into stage vomited. He was scared as hell. But he still showed up.

There is nothing special in myself that tells that I\\u2019m a person that can do this kind of thing. That is what we have gotten wrong about creativity. Society thinks that it is about inspiration. It is not. It is about just sitting down and Doing The Work. Being consistent about it. Caring about it.

If you don\\u2019t have enough, just start for 30 minutes every day. Just be consistent with it, and be open to the transformation that will happen within yourself. If you are reading this, I invite you to devote 30 minutes every day to create something that didn\\u2019t exist before. I repeat: It doesn\\u2019t matter what it is. Just do it. Open up to a better understanding of who you are by doing it.\"}),`\n`,(0,e.jsx)(t.p,{children:`We have been trained to think that this is not the way, because in schools they used to give us grades for how good our work was.

What matters is the heart that you put in the thing. The amount of presence that you bring into what you are creating. Because it is not about who will receive what you create, it is about how transformed you are throughout the process.\nThe world will receive it from there. That will be the impact that it will have, because the fact that you are a different person after facing the void of creating from nowhere definetly has an impact in the world. You may not be able to notice it directly, but it will. At least you will have something new to talk about. Do you remember how you felt when you talked about that time that you did something for 10 days in a row? Do you know how it feels to do it for 100?

Maybe that is the nuclear war that every one is talking about. It is time to nuke ourselves without mercy, to see what stays afterwards.

          "raw": "\nI have a tendency to over complicate things, and because of that, not being able to create a successful communication between me and the one that I want to reach out with the message. I’m sorry… I’m working on that.\n\nA strong pattern of action is being manifested as I go through this process of writing as a means of integration of what is happening through me. There is clarity related to where this whole thing is going, but it is clear that the way I’m building it right now is not working because I’m jumping over stages of my development. Right now I’m training to be a breathwork facilitator, and I’m going through my process of awakening, and what comes now is that I need to establish myself deeply in those processes so that I can act from there.\n\nAs I talk about Dukkha, there is confusion about what it is. The relationship that the project has with the name, why is it about suffering, how will it be played out. I’m very good at having a vision of how things are going to look like in the future, but I’m very bad a realizing which are the steps that are needed to take in order to get there. But is that true? I have had a strong vision for myself, and I have walked every path in the road to get me where I am at now. And I’m building up everything that I am over the bricks of consistency, of sitting down and Doing The Work. Realizing that every major change is built over small changes, and with that, be willing to walk those small steps that bring about the small changes in my every day life, which then add up to big changes that I can’t even recognize because they happened progressively because of the way that I did the thing.\n\nThat is something that I need to acknowledge, and embrace, and be proud of. That is something that I want to bring more of to the world. Because overnight successes are not the norm, and are not the way to go. There needs to be a progressive development of the individual in order to get to where he wants to get, and that is what this whole book is about. The power of Doing The Work. Dukkha is just an excuse, a frame of reference that I have built so that I can better convey the message of what is needed to do in order to get there. Big masters speak about it on different ways: Enlightment, Awakening, The Now, Presence, God. Those are all pointers towards a state of being, a way of existing in the world, that is not associated with time.\n\nThat is the aspect of the whole thing that I find more fascinating. The trascendence of time. The internalization that it is a human construct, something that is a consequence of the mind, and not a consequence of there being life. Life doesn’t care abour time. If you could talk to your dog about time, he would not understand what you are talking about. The dog just is. It has an internal clock, which accounts for the way that its biology works and gives a certain pattern of repetition to the needs that the dog has, but in its structure of experiencing reality there is not an aspect of being called time.\n\nThat is only on us.\n\nAnd it is not eternal. It doesn’t need to be that way. And what I’m doing here is pointing you, and me, toward the state of being that is associated with the absence of the notion of time. I’m talking about pure presence. This is the biggest gift that you can give yourself in this lifetime, because it means leaving behind all the shoulds. The past should have been this way. The future should be that way. This moment should be different. The way of existing that I’m sharing with you here speaks about the end of shoulds. Erasing that word from our vocabulary, and embracing everything that is, just as it is.\n\nTo be clear: There is a big difference between accepting what is as it is and being a passive rock that is just breathing in the world and not activating its life force in any way. Dukkha is not about that. It is about being more efficient with the energy that you have available so that you can direct it to the things that really matter: to the complete expression of your creative potential. There is an incredible amount of energy spent in your system to feed the patterns of behavior that drive your experience as a conditioned human being, and Dukkha is about freeing that energy so that it can be directed consciously towards the object of your creation. To your craft. To the expression of who you truly are. Not who you have thought to be all this time.\n\nIt is an invitation to explore. To be the witness of the universe unfolding within yourself. To be amazed. To be open. To bring about what has been waiting in there, latent, expecting for its time to shine. There is a fundamental force within you that wants to wake up, and Dukkha is about creating the means for that force to come forth. It is about building community around this process, so that together the transformational journeys are built in an iterative way. There is no perfect path towards this understanding, and what I’m doing here is opening the door for an exploration into those paths using the experience of all the human beings that will participate. Of all of those that want to be the explorers.\n\nEach one of us is unique on its own way, and the internet gives us the opportunity to connect with people from all over the world. This is a window into the understanding of what makes us different, be amazed by that, but also into what is similar within ourselves. Each person is an individual flame of something much bigger than what we can conceive with the rational mind, and Dukkha is about realizing that flame within yourself so that we can truly build a better world that comes as a consequence of the word love. Pure love. Gratitude. Pure gratitude.\n\nEach Transformational Journey that will be conducted is just that, an exploration, and over time we will be better able to examine the way it worked, and how it didn’t work. It will be very important for the system to have in place methods for each individual to be able to convey how the program helped or not in her path, so that we, as a collective, can make decisions about how to design it for further occasions. These TJs will be organized and conducted in community, and the technologies that are in place in this moment of humanity are a prompt for that. Especially Blockchain, and the way on which it enables a decentralized governance, where the participants of a network will be able to be in charge of how it is developed.\n\nDukkha is a network, with the specific intention to end human suffering. People from all over the world joining forces to face their biggest fears, the deepest aspects of what they have not resolved within themselves, so that they can become free. And that freedom is the end of shoulds. It is the absolute absence of willingness for things to be in a different way than what they are. The absence of expectations. It is the absence of time, because time is a construct that is built around the notion of wanting things to be different. But there is truly nothing to change: life is change itself. We will walk towards the understanding of this truth together and build up the means for more and more people to do it.\n\nThere are uncountable paths that different groups of humans have developed to walk towards the truth of our being. To our connection with god, with our true nature, name it as you want. But those paths have always been centralized, governed by a particular authority that decides which is the proper way to behave. In most of the cases, there has been a specific agenda behind the way on which spirituality has been shown to the world. The truth has been hidden behind dogmas and conditioned practices, which you have to follow in order to be worthy of the truth.\n\nBut you don’t need to be worthy of anything. The truth is just within yourself, and in Dukkha we are going to build the religion of the future: A decentralized religion. One without a central authority that commands the way on which you behave in order to evolve spiritually. Nope. That commandment will come from the depth of your being, and this journey will be a quest towards what is your own particular truth.\n\nAsk yourself deep within: What is this truth? Ask yourself this question, over and over, until there are no doubts. Each time a concept arises, ask yourself: Is that the truth? Go deeper into that inquiry, until what is left is not understandable. The truth is beyond what you can conceive as true. There is not an aspect of it that can be comprehended by the ‘you’ that you have been identified with. It is unthinkable. Everything that I’m doing here is just conceptualize pointers towards that truth, but you are the one that needs to travel that path. No one can do it for you. But we will be there, side by side, walking it together. In community. Helping us and the future travelers by finding better ways of travelling the path.\n\nDukkha is about finding the pointers. Discovering which are the ones that we can create together to foster this process in humanity as a whole. In that sense, it is an exploration into what happens when we open up the door to create a religion together. The religion of truth. We are the truth seekers. We are the ones that are thirsty for it, and that are willing to give up everything to get there. Because you have to. You have to be willing to give up all your world so that you can realize that it was just a concept inside your mind. And be aware: It is brutal. It is hard. You will die. This is the journey on which you will learn how to die before you die. Are you willing to go down that rabbit hole? We are waiting for you.\n\nThere is an aspect of this whole thing that is important for me to clarify, and now I will try to do it. In meditation, there is a concept called samskaras, which are the blockages that we have in our system, and that are related to karmic situations that have not been dealt with in the past. As you deepen your practice, you are able to face those blockages directly, and with that, open up the opportunity to integrate them by accepting them as part of reality. There are unconscious aspects of our being, most of them related to fear, anger, or unresolved circumstances, that leave this deep imprint in the way that energy is able to flow within us.\n\nWith conscious effort, you begin to have a relationship with them that comes from a place of equanimity, of not wanting to change anything. This enables the samskara to dissolve. The consequence of dissolving them is the free flow of energy, and the ever going expression of consciousness through the individual. As energy becomes free from these conditioned patterns, consciousness is able to express itself fully through you.\n\nMy theory is that our society is full of samskaras, and those are the aspects of our relationships that are and have been hidden to our view. Consciousness may be understood as information, and there are systems that are in place that don’t let it flow freely. It gets stuck in the willingness that people have to control. To hold positions of power. To be afraid. The truth is hidden to us, because there are people that don’t want us to know it. To experience it. And I mean the truth in every sense. But with the technologies that are in place, everything will come forth. Everything will be open. Free.\n\nThere will be a new understanding of humanity and our relationship with ourselves, and what has been in place until now will cease to have an impact because it is not the most efficient way of energy to move. And consciousness wants to express itself, so it is doing its work. It is opening the pathways, freeing the samskaras. And it fucking hurts! When a samskara is freed in the body, often the sensations and feelings that are associated with it come back. You can experience the most intense pain of your life, or grief, or an urge to laugh. Whatever. The same with the ones of society. We are seeing right now a transformation in the way that all this thing works, and it is showing up as stuff that is not nice. But we will go through it, and what comes at the other side is beautiful.\n\nBlockchain technologies open the world for these changes to happen because they enable information to flow freely within the system of how we relate to each other. It is the evolutionary means that we need to free up the collective samskaras, by building new means for information to flow. Without centralization, and with full transparency. Everything will be in there. There is no way out of it.\n\nDukkha is about building the religion of the future in the blockchain. A religion that is based on the truth. On your truth. It is not about going to a particular place to please any concept that you may have of what is divine, it is about deepening your relationship with yourself so that you can truly experience what it means to be free from suffering. For you to discover that you are the divine embodied in a human being. For you to create from the bottom of your soul the beauty that this world will see in the coming years. That is the future in which we will live, one based on truth, love & gratitude. We are going to build it together.\n\nWelcome to the next stage in our evolutionary path.\n\nAnd why building Dukkha inside web3, and why with NFT’s and why blockchain?\n\nBecause I feel it. Very deep inside. There has always been a noise inside me, and when I think about this way of moving forward that noise transforms into energy that wants to be in service. And most of the things that I have seen that are being created in this space make me hopeful. It is more than worth trying, because I have the feeling that the people that are part of the community are truly wanting to add their dime to help. Become more connected to our true essence, to what we really are. There is amazing people pushing this whole thing forward, and I want to be part of them. It is about feeling a sense of belonging also. It is about transforming my life force with intention into something that will add value to the whole community.\n\nAnd also because I want to be transparent. Every part of me wants to be transparent so that I don’t have to waste not even a small amount of my energy into pretending to be something that I’m not. What a waste of my most precious resource. I want to be everything that I am, and embody it. Blockchain gives me that opportunity by making things transparent, traceable, and open. I’m not even close to understanding the implications of building in web3, or the implications of anything that I’ve talked about. But I don’t care too much about it, because I trust. I know that this is something that is being developed every day with people that are putting a lot of effort into it, and I will be one of those. I will be co-creating this new way of fostering quality relationships between humans.\n\nBuilding the future. Doing The Work.\n\n---\n\nI want to develop a little bit here what has been coming into me related to the way on which the whole system will work (at least at first. It may evolve afterward as there will be more and more people being part of it and making decisions. Nothing is fixed in stone. I’m just setting in motion a snowball here, I’m not attached emotionally to it growing in any way, my mission is just to throw it down the slope).\n\nSo this community of practice will be open to whoever wants to participate, but for that, the individual will have to go through a Transformational Journey. That is the price that they must pay to enter. The first transformational journey will be commanded by me. I had been thinking about using psychedelics as the means for starting the whole thing, but now that I think about it better it makes sense not to do it because it closes doors. There is something that is needed to do externally to get them, and they are illegal in most parts of the world, so this is going to put friction into the system. And I want to eliminate any kind of friction that I can, so we will only work with what is present in every human being that is alive: the breath.\n\nWe’ll enter altered states of consciousness just breathing together, which everyone in the world can do, and is completely safe. This practice will clear the way for us to remember how to live in the present moment, and from there, a clear connection to your creative expression will arise. This journey is about learning how to live in the present.\n\nThere won’t be a ticket that they will have to pay for being part of the journey, it will be free. The only thing that is needed from them is that during the whole TJ they work on a digital creative project, which at the end of the journey will be transformed into an NFT. This NFT will then be part of the ecosystem of Dukkha, and the artist will be able to sell it or do whatever he wants with it, having a percentage of the money paid in every future transaction associated with it coming to Dukkha (we’ll start with 8%, which can be then evaluated and updated if necessary, in every journey). The artistic project will be created using the MSquared standard so that it can be displayed in as many metaverses as possible.\n\nThe world of the future will be a blend of the digital and the physical world, and the idea for this thing is that people are able to share what they have created in the different communities that they will be part of. Eventually, there will be a place in each one of those metaverses where we’ll gather to Do The Work and Do The Rest. Something like the temples that exist all around the world to connect with the divine, but in the digital realm. This temple will exist with the sole purpose of worshipping beauty, and eventually what will happen is that each NFT that will be created in the TJ will be something to decorate the temple. Creating beauty as the means of worshipping life. Holding the space for the expression of beauty that can be created by the presence of each individual human being.\n\nThis project will create rites of passage. In modern society there are few events that mark the transition from one stage of life into another, and Dukkha is an answer to that. It is something that is needed. I would have spent most of my life in such a different way if I had gone through a TJ when I was 18, deciding ‘what I would do with my life’. It even sounds stupid to write that, but it is important to acknowledge that in this moment of history most people define ‘who they will be’ through what they go to university to study. And that happens at this moment of life, just after puberty, where traditionally ancient societies had rites of passage that marked the step into adulthood. These gave them the tools that they needed to be autonomous individuals, responsible and conscious. Now there is in place a system that is very different from this, so what is being created here is a new way of doing.\n\nThere will be a transformation that will take place, and this transformation will happen with your effort. With your willingness to be transformed. To open your eyes. There won’t be anything else than the truth here, the truth of your own being.\n\nThere are places in the whole rest of the universe to study about ancient religions, or traditions, or philosophy, or whatever. This place is not for that. This place will be just for Doing The Work. It will be safe space on which you will realize that everything that you need to be complete is there, within yourself. You are already complete; you just don’t know it yet.\n\nThat feels good. I feel that everything is taking its place, and I’m more focused than ever to make this thing happen. To bring it into life. I’ve demonstrated to myself that when I have to Do The Work I don’t have any problem doing it, and it was about time for me to trust myself enough so that I could create something from scratch. This whole manifesto is the way on which I understand everything that I have inside so that I can bring it into life. It is the translation of my own process of growth, of my own evolution into a timeless being. It is the crystallization of everything that I am into something that will add value to the world, because it will help everyone that will be part of these journeys to become a better version more of themselves.\n\nIt's about lifting up the fog that won’t let them see what lies just in front.\n\nIt’s about discovering who they already are.\n\n---\n\nThere is not too much to say, I feel very complete with what has come up today, but there is still time left so I will just be the witness of what happens. I’m listening to an album from Entheogenic called Enthymesis, and a song popped up that I could not hold myself to start playing in repeat over and over again. It is called the same as the album, Enthymesis, and what a great concept. A quick lookup on the internet brings a way of explaining it: ‘comprehensive thought belonging to matter’. It is a way of speaking about intuition.\n\nAnd yes, everything that has been spoken until now in these 17 days of writing point towards that, because being present is eliminating the gap between the place from which you direct your actions and the action itself. You become the action. And that is what intuition is about, to relate to life in a way that is not mediated by the mind. It is matter thinking for itself about what to do in a particular situation, and you just being a witness in that cosmic dance.\n\nThat is the exploration that Dukkha will bring about. Building systems for you to realize how to relate to life so that you can be in the driver's seat, realizing that you are much more than what you think they are. Lighting up that fire of intuition. Bringing about the animal from within. Free. Alive.\n\nLife is such an amazing miracle, Dukkha is an exploration into what makes it worth living. Into just being.\n\nThere may be a feeling of being alone in this journey right now for me, as if there was no one by my side. But each one of those that have gone through this thing is next to me.

But is that true? I have had a strong vision for myself, and I have walked every path in the road to get me where I am at now. And I\\u2019m building up everything that I am over the bricks of consistency, of sitting down and Doing The Work.

Dukkha is just an excuse, a frame of reference that I have built so that I can better convey the message of what is needed to do in order to get there.

If you could talk to your dog about time, he would not understand what you are talking about. The dog just is.

There is an incredible amount of energy spent in your system to feed the patterns of behavior that drive your experience as a conditioned human being, and Dukkha is about freeing that energy so that it can be directed consciously towards the object of your creation.

It is about building community around this process, so that together the transformational journeys are built in an iterative way.

These TJs will be organized and conducted in community, and the technologies that are in place in this moment of humanity are a prompt for that.

People from all over the world joining forces to face their biggest fears, the deepest aspects of what they have not resolved within themselves, so that they can become free. And that freedom is the end of shoulds. It is the absolute absence of willingness for things to be in a different way than what they are. The absence of expectations. It is the absence of time, because time is a construct that is built around the notion of wanting things to be different. But there is truly nothing to change: life is change itself. We will walk towards the understanding of this truth together and build up the means for more and more people to do it.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"There are uncountable paths that different groups of humans have developed to walk towards the truth of our being. To our connection with god, with our true nature, name it as you want. But those paths have always been centralized, governed by a particular authority that decides which is the proper way to behave. In most of the cases, there has been a specific agenda behind the way on which spirituality has been shown to the world. The truth has been hidden behind dogmas and conditioned practices, which you have to follow in order to be worthy of the truth.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"But you don\\u2019t need to be worthy of anything. The truth is just within yourself, and in Dukkha we are going to build the religion of the future: A decentralized religion.

That commandment will come from the depth of your being, and this journey will be a quest towards what is your own particular truth.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Ask yourself deep within: What is this truth? Ask yourself this question, over and over, until there are no doubts. Each time a concept arises, ask yourself: Is that the truth?

There is not an aspect of it that can be comprehended by the \\u2018you\\u2019 that you have been identified with. It is unthinkable. Everything that I\\u2019m doing here is just conceptualize pointers towards that truth, but you are the one that needs to travel that path. No one can do it for you.

Helping us and the future travelers by finding better ways of travelling the path.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Dukkha is about finding the pointers. Discovering which are the ones that we can create together to foster this process in humanity as a whole. In that sense, it is an exploration into what happens when we open up the door to create a religion together. The religion of truth. We are the truth seekers. We are the ones that are thirsty for it, and that are willing to give up everything to get there. Because you have to. You have to be willing to give up all your world so that you can realize that it was just a concept inside your mind. And be aware: It is brutal. It is hard. You will die. This is the journey on which you will learn how to die before you die. Are you willing to go down that rabbit hole? We are waiting for you.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"There is an aspect of this whole thing that is important for me to clarify, and now I will try to do it. In meditation, there is a concept called samskaras, which are the blockages that we have in our system, and that are related to karmic situations that have not been dealt with in the past. As you deepen your practice, you are able to face those blockages directly, and with that, open up the opportunity to integrate them by accepting them as part of reality. There are unconscious aspects of our being, most of them related to fear, anger, or unresolved circumstances, that leave this deep imprint in the way that energy is able to flow within us.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"With conscious effort, you begin to have a relationship with them that comes from a place of equanimity, of not wanting to change anything. This enables the samskara to dissolve. The consequence of dissolving them is the free flow of energy, and the ever going expression of consciousness through the individual. As energy becomes free from these conditioned patterns, consciousness is able to express itself fully through you.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"My theory is that our society is full of samskaras, and those are the aspects of our relationships that are and have been hidden to our view. Consciousness may be understood as information, and there are systems that are in place that don\\u2019t let it flow freely. It gets stuck in the willingness that people have to control. To hold positions of power. To be afraid. The truth is hidden to us, because there are people that don\\u2019t want us to know it. To experience it. And I mean the truth in every sense. But with the technologies that are in place, everything will come forth. Everything will be open. Free.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"There will be a new understanding of humanity and our relationship with ourselves, and what has been in place until now will cease to have an impact because it is not the most efficient way of energy to move. And consciousness wants to express itself, so it is doing its work. It is opening the pathways, freeing the samskaras. And it fucking hurts! When a samskara is freed in the body, often the sensations and feelings that are associated with it come back. You can experience the most intense pain of your life, or grief, or an urge to laugh. Whatever. The same with the ones of society. We are seeing right now a transformation in the way that all this thing works, and it is showing up as stuff that is not nice. But we will go through it, and what comes at the other side is beautiful.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Blockchain technologies open the world for these changes to happen because they enable information to flow freely within the system of how we relate to each other.

Everything will be in there. There is no way out of it.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Dukkha is about building the religion of the future in the blockchain. A religion that is based on the truth. On your truth. It is not about going to a particular place to please any concept that you may have of what is divine, it is about deepening your relationship with yourself so that you can truly experience what it means to be free from suffering. For you to discover that you are the divine embodied in a human being. For you to create from the bottom of your soul the beauty that this world will see in the coming years.

Very deep inside. There has always been a noise inside me, and when I think about this way of moving forward that noise transforms into energy that wants to be in service. And most of the things that I have seen that are being created in this space make me hopeful. It is more than worth trying, because I have the feeling that the people that are part of the community are truly wanting to add their dime to help. Become more connected to our true essence, to what we really are. There is amazing people pushing this whole thing forward, and I want to be part of them. It is about feeling a sense of belonging also. It is about transforming my life force with intention into something that will add value to the whole community.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And also because I want to be transparent. Every part of me wants to be transparent so that I don\\u2019t have to waste not even a small amount of my energy into pretending to be something that I\\u2019m not.

I\\u2019m not even close to understanding the implications of building in web3, or the implications of anything that I\\u2019ve talked about. But I don\\u2019t care too much about it, because I trust.

There is something that is needed to do externally to get them, and they are illegal in most parts of the world, so this is going to put friction into the system.

This NFT will then be part of the ecosystem of Dukkha, and the artist will be able to sell it or do whatever he wants with it, having a percentage of the money paid in every future transaction associated with it coming to Dukkha (we\\u2019ll start with 8%, which can be then evaluated and updated if necessary, in every journey). The artistic project will be created using the MSquared standard so that it can be displayed in as many metaverses as possible.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"The world of the future will be a blend of the digital and the physical world, and the idea for this thing is that people are able to share what they have created in the different communities that they will be part of.

Something like the temples that exist all around the world to connect with the divine, but in the digital realm. This temple will exist with the sole purpose of worshipping beauty, and eventually what will happen is that each NFT that will be created in the TJ will be something to decorate the temple. Creating beauty as the means of worshipping life. Holding the space for the expression of beauty that can be created by the presence of each individual human being.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"This project will create rites of passage. In modern society there are few events that mark the transition from one stage of life into another, and Dukkha is an answer to that. It is something that is needed. I would have spent most of my life in such a different way if I had gone through a TJ when I was 18, deciding \\u2018what I would do with my life\\u2019. It even sounds stupid to write that, but it is important to acknowledge that in this moment of history most people define \\u2018who they will be\\u2019 through what they go to university to study. And that happens at this moment of life, just after puberty, where traditionally ancient societies had rites of passage that marked the step into adulthood.

This whole manifesto is the way on which I understand everything that I have inside so that I can bring it into life.

          "raw": "\nThe purpose of this book is to end the suffering. My suffering. I’m walking this road so that I can speak from a place of truth, because all of what I’m doing now is point towards where I think the truth is, and I get lost on that. There is a lot of noise on where I am at. It is tough. Today is one of those days when it is hard to move on, because things are not clear. I decided to sleep more than usual, and give me the space to rest. I realized that having a strict rule of writing 4 hours will end up in a nightmare for myself, so I will have that as a goal to strive for, but not something so strict that makes me go mad. I don’t want to go crazy in this quest, it is not the idea. The idea is to become free, and if I’m not able to give me some space when it is needed I will never understand what being free is about. How can I be free if I don’t let me? That is the big question.\n\nI always speak about wanting to help other people to end their suffering, but now it is important to acknowledge how selfish I have been. It’s not the other’s people suffering that I want to help end, I’m dying so that I can end mine. I’m tired of it. It has been enough. That’s why Dukkha is the name of this project, because when I went to the retreat in the Samadhi Center one of the first things that Dan said was that Dukkha is something like eternal unsatisfactoriness. I felt so represented by that concept that it stuck with me all the time, and it is present always. That is what this suffering is about. Not being satisfied by what is. By what life is offering to me in every moment. It is a deep sensation that is felt inside that is related to not being content with with what is in front of me. And I suffer from that, since a long time. And I want to be free. I know that there is a way out of this maze, and all this writing is my exploration into the way out. It is me running around the maze of my own mind trying to find the way out of it.\n\nBut the problem is that I know that it doesn’t work like that, so I’m stuck. How can I get out of my mind from inside the mind? It doesn’t work like that. But I already started with this exploration, with this writing, and it is a commitment that I did with myself to do it. Should I continue or should I stop? But if I stop, what would I do next? I’m giving all my energy to this thing, it is the only thing that I do for work in my life, and if I stop doing it, what comes next?\n\nThere is nothing more important that ending the suffering. Is this the right way? And there you can be a witness of the mind doing its thing again, dividing and polarizing. What does right mean? Who is the one that is judging if it is right or wrong? The mind. Because it wants to know. It wants to know how to do it, so it assumes that there is a right way and a wrong way. But there isn’t. There is only one way, and that is the way forward, the way of the heart, the way of the willingness to explore into the unknown. And every time I come here and start writing is an exploration into that unknown.\n\nThe mind feels uncomfortable with that not knowing, and that is why there is resistance in place. That is why in the morning there was a willingness to give up. Because of the unknown. That is why the noise is always present there, because it fills up the space. It feels comfortable. The void is scary. But I want to go in there, I know that that is the place where freedom is. The end of suffering is inside the void. No one can go in there, so I need to dissolve my notion of I into nothingness, and everything, at the same time. But as soon as I write that there is more complexity present, the complexity that comes up from wanting, and wanting, and wanting to get out. So fuck it, I’ll write about another thing.\n\n--\n\nI feel very frustrated with my journey as a father these last days. Mila is crying a lot, and there is not a clear understanding of why she cries. I feel a slight disconnection with her, and this constant urge that is present inside of wanting to do something more ‘important’ than just being there trying to connect with her and not being able. There is something like an eternal willingness to do stuff that involves thinking, of studying, or creating, and I’m not able to reconcile that with the fact of enjoying that time with her. Maybe that is where there is a window into a better understanding of the situation, because I used the word enjoying. Am I supposed to enjoy every time that I’m with her?\n\nThat is the same society’s motto that I have been avoiding actively on the last months. Every time that someone asks me ‘How are you?’, there is a deep urge inside me to not answer ‘good and you?’, as I have done my whole life. I’m sick of that lie. Who can always be good? How many feelings and emotions are suppressed because of ‘being good’ in spite of not being good? And it is the same in this situation with my daughter. Should I truly enjoy every moment with her from the sense of it being something that brings ‘good’ feelings to me? I don’t think so. It feels like the same that answering ‘good’ when I’m not good.\n\nIt is important to realize this, because spending the afternoon with her is important. I have not been able to establish it as a ritual, as something sacred, but this is the moment on which I realize that and I make it conscious. I had written that this is the moment on which I change it, but it can’t be like that, because it is a behavior that will be changed as soon as I establish a new one. It won’t be changed by magic. I’ve got to Do The Work also. Show up to her. Be there.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if I’m not happy, or having good feelings, or whatever. The important thing is to spend that time together and get to know each other better. And I can recognize that the presence of her mother conspires with this, because I’m always counting on her to do the stuff when it gets hard. If she cries a lot, there she is to make her not cry. If it is hard to put her to sleep, there she is to do it. And that is not helping me establish a deep relationship with Mila. This is something that is important to realize, because those moments of her crying loud and me not being able to calm her down are the ones that bond us. They put us both through something uncomfortable together, and because of that, we grow into a deeper connection with each other.\n\nIt is not about it being good or bad, it is just about it being. It is about spending that time together and navigating the waters of whatever comes up. That is the important thing, and I had not been able to realize it enough to make the moment with her a ritual in my life. That is the most important thing that I have to do. So what am I doing saying that there is nothing else that I have to do in my life. Of course there is. She is the consequence of everything that I am, and I will give her every emotion that is in me.\n\nThat is something big that I realized yesterday also. I have a perception that usually parents hold a lot of their emotions when they are with their kids, for them to see them always in a way that is ‘positive’. It is not common for parents to cry in front of their kids for example, or to be angry in front of them, or to be sad. They tend to hide this from the kid, so that it doesn’t see them ‘like that’. This is a big harm that they do to them, because they show them only a particular part of what being a human being is, and then the kid doesn’t know what emotion is what they are feeling when they feel sad, or angry, or whatever. That’s why it is important to let yourself experience the full arrange of emotions in front of your children, so that they can truly realize what being a human is. Life is not only happy moments, or beautiful feelings. There are hard things also, and if we teach them from the beginning about them being there they will grow as more integral human beings.\n\nThis is why it is so important to have this moment with Mila as something sacred, because with that I will open myself to showing her everything of what I am, without holding anything back. And she will learn that life is about ups and downs, and that it is ok to experience that rollercoaster. I truly want to be there for her, and I realize that I have not been able to do it in a way that makes me feel proud. But no one told me how to be a father, and this is the way that I learn.\n\n--\n\nThe sun comes and goes from within the clouds, sharing with me its rays with the heat that comes with them, and then the sky hiding them to remember me that everything is changing. I get used to the nice heat, it feels good, warm, and then it goes away and there is a slight feeling of coldness. It has been like this, all this morning, and part of me wants it to stop. I just want the good sunrays in me, I want to feel that heat, I want to feel good. I just want to feel good, that is the thing. I want to feel warm, loved, secure. I have exposed myself to a lot of stress the last year trying to push through my own mind, kind of trying to break it, and there doesn’t seem to be a limit to that. And part of me just want it to stop, be warm, and loved. But I am loved. We all are. It is just that we forget about it, and we tend to focus only in what is missing. What is not there.\n\nThere is people that love me, there is people that care about me, and there is an urge inside me to also love myself. To care about myself. Today specifically how to do that is not clear, but I’m writing to discover it. Today I slept in and my wife woke me up and started telling me that I needed to go to the office, to write, to work, and the only thing that came up for me was asking: ‘For what?’. And she seemed to not understand the question. ‘For what?’. What is the reason why I’m doing what I’m doing? What is the intention behind coming here and writing all these words? Maybe it is not clear enough inside me, and that is why I slept in today in the morning. I don’t have the mission clear enough inside myself, and that is why at the first perturbance of the system with weird feelings I fail. But did I really fail? Is this failing? Is not writing the 4 hours of the day failing? What does that mean? Who is the one that fails? Is someone else than myself going to tell me ‘You are a failure!’. Nope. It is just me. It is just the voice that I have inside myself that is always pushing me towards the limit, aiming for me to do more than what I can do. Aiming for things to be different from what they are, always. That is what brings the suffering, because it will never be enough. No matter how early I wake up, no matter how much I write, no matter how much I study, no matter how much money I earn, it will never be enough for me.\n\nSo that me needs to go away. The point of reference from which reality has been experienced from my perspective needs to shift. That is what awakening is. That is what becoming free is. That is where the suffering ends. When there is an absolute realization that the I that is suffering is an illusion. But how to get there? No fucking clue. I’m lost. I’m confused. I’m beginning to give up. But maybe that is good. Maybe that is the way forward.\n\nFor what?\n\nThat is the question. It is for me. And for everyone that is impacted by the way on which I exist. I come here to write as a means of becoming free, so it is for me. I need it. I need to vomit everything that I have inside so that I can become free of it, so that I can move towards a better understanding of my biases, of my unconscious patterns, and with that be free. It is time to be free. And all my work is for that. Everything that I’m doing is a journey towards that freedom, and this book will be a testament of how much heart I put into it. When I don’t show up, it is because there is a part of me that thinks that this is not the way, because I will not be able to ‘achieve something through this process’. As if writing was not the way to ‘become enlightened’. As if there was something different, more specific, more effective, to go through this process. There isn’t. There is only showing up, and staring at the void with my arms open. I’m back. Show me what you have for me today.\n\nI may be running in circles for the next 69 days, but this circle is going to be one of the biggest landmarks of my life. There will be a moment on which I will look back and realize what I have done. I will look back and be proud for the road that has been walked. For the realizations that have been had. For the knowledge of myself that will have been achieved. There is nothing more important to do in this lifetime than the process of knowing thyself, and that is what I’m doing here, every day on which I show up to write.\n\nI’m doing it for myself, and because of that, for every person that I will interact with in the rest of my life. It is not selfish, it is completely the opposite. It is the most humble thing that I can do. Showing up with all what I have to deepen the relationship that I have with myself. No one cares, no one reads, no one interacts with this content, but it doesn’t matter. I do. I am the one that is here, writing these words, feeling what I’m feeling inside, and that is everything that matters. No one will become free for me, it is only up to me to do it. It is me the one that is willing to die to be free, I don’t want to impose that burden into the rest. They don’t need to. This is just inside my mind.\n\nSo yes, it is for me. I don’t know how doing this impacts the world, but it doesn’t matter. It is just for me.\n\n--\n\nSomething that pops up very intensely as I write down that I’m willing to die to be free is actually the connection that all this project has with people that are depressed. They are always in my heart as I think about this thing. I don’t feel that I am depressed myself, maybe I am, I don’t really care. The thing about depression is that the people that end up committing suicide are also willing to die to be free, and I want to explore here with my thoughts what is the relationship between that willingness to die and the one that is needed to become free from Dukkha. How can the ‘giving up’ from depressed people be paralleled to the giving up of the ego that needs to happen so that the awakening process can unfold? Is that even true? Is that even necessary? I’m not an expert in this, so please don’t take my words as a rule. I’m just exploring the words that come through my writing, and thinking on what is going on as they come.\n\nThere is not a curiosity related to this, there is a certainty that there is a connection between both willingness to die. For the sake of the exercise, let’s talk about Pedro, who is 18 and very close to committing suicide. He doesn’t see the way out. He is at the end of a road, of the road of suffering, and there is no more way out from it than killing himself. The point about this is that every part of that road is within the confines of his own mind. Everything that Pedro experiences is part of mind, and that is why there is not another door to continue than suicide, because that is all of what he can see. The door of freedom, of awakening, is there, but he can’t see it from his perspective because all what he can experience from Pedro’s perspective is mind. He is willing to give up being Pedro, he has had so much of the suffering, that he is willing to die, but if he only knew that there was another route, another way of dying that doesn’t involve killing himself, there would be hope.\n\nAll these Pedro’s are the ones that I have in my heart when I’m writing, and when I’m building this whole system. It is about giving them the opportunity to come back to life. To live it from a new perspective, one that is different from the one that they have been experiencing until now. It is a perspective that is outside of mind, outside the maze from which they have been living this nightmare all this time. So how can Pedro be shown that there is another door in that ultimate moment? Which are the techniques and practices that are the most effective for those moments? Dukkha is an exploration into that. It is about bringing those that are depressed the most and giving them a glimpse into that new door, so that with the help of the Transformational Journey they can realize that there is another way. Not killing themselves, but killing their self. How is this going to be done? We are going to create a whole organization just to build up these TJs. That is the mission. That’s the what for that I was asking my wife. For Pedro, and for all of those that are very deep into depression. That are willing to die to end up the suffering. Those are the ones that are more primed to actually die before they die. That is the thing. To help them realize that there is a way of dying that makes you be more alive than ever.\n\nThis whole book is an exploration into what that way is.\n\nIt is about sharing my own experience in that quest, in that discovery, so that you can become free. I don’t care if I will ever become free. I may not, this may be me running in circles forever, but it doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is that all of this ends up being written, because it will be a testament of how fucking hard this whole thing is. How crazy the mind is, and how many stories it can tell itself.\n\nI may never become free, and it is ok like that. I accept it, and move on with my day. It is time to go and say good morning to my little girl.\n",

There is a lot of noise on where I am at. It is tough. Today is one of those days when it is hard to move on, because things are not clear. I decided to sleep more than usual, and give me the space to rest.

I felt so represented by that concept that it stuck with me all the time, and it is present always. That is what this suffering is about. Not being satisfied by what is. By what life is offering to me in every moment. It is a deep sensation that is felt inside that is related to not being content with with what is in front of me.

I\\u2019m just exploring the words that come through my writing, and thinking on what is going on as they come.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"There is not a curiosity related to this, there is a certainty that there is a connection between both willingness to die. For the sake of the exercise, let\\u2019s talk about Pedro, who is 18 and very close to committing suicide. He doesn\\u2019t see the way out. He is at the end of a road, of the road of suffering, and there is no more way out from it than killing himself. The point about this is that every part of that road is within the confines of his own mind. Everything that Pedro experiences is part of mind, and that is why there is not another door to continue than suicide, because that is all of what he can see. The door of freedom, of awakening, is there, but he can\\u2019t see it from his perspective because all what he can experience from Pedro\\u2019s perspective is mind. He is willing to give up being Pedro, he has had so much of the suffering, that he is willing to die, but if he only knew that there was another route, another way of dying that doesn\\u2019t involve killing himself, there would be hope.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"All these Pedro\\u2019s are the ones that I have in my heart when I\\u2019m writing, and when I\\u2019m building this whole system. It is about giving them the opportunity to come back to life. To live it from a new perspective, one that is different from the one that they have been experiencing until now. It is a perspective that is outside of mind, outside the maze from which they have been living this nightmare all this time. So how can Pedro be shown that there is another door in that ultimate moment? Which are the techniques and practices that are the most effective for those moments? Dukkha is an exploration into that. It is about bringing those that are depressed the most and giving them a glimpse into that new door, so that with the help of the Transformational Journey they can realize that there is another way. Not killing themselves, but killing their self. How is this going to be done? We are going to create a whole organization just to build up these TJs. That is the mission. That\\u2019s the what for that I was asking my wife. For Pedro, and for all of those that are very deep into depression. That are willing to die to end up the suffering. Those are the ones that are more primed to actually die before they die. That is the thing.

          "raw": "\nDepression is probably the human condition that amazes me the most. The one that I think is most important to tackle on this day and age, because it is also one of the most prevailing ones. And I can see the way out of how present it is, and that is not by forcing children to use social media in a different way, its about creating new conditions and new options that are better than that.\n\nEvery time that willpower is the way to go, it ends up in failure. Have you ever tried to diet using solely the power of will? It becomes a nightmare. Something similar can be said about recycling for example, because people are not going to do it if there is not a direct incentive for it.\n\nThat’s why a big aspect of Dukkha is deep and conscious creative work. It is one of the pillars of the whole thing. My thesis is that as soon as they discover that there is a means for expressing the particularities of all of who they are in the world through an original creation of their own, the willingness to spend time and energy in stuff that drains their life force will go down, and the willingness to give energy to activities that do the opposite will grow. But there needs to be an incentive in play, something for them to realize that there is something here. Something valuable and that can change their life.\n\nI wonder how this will play in reality. I’m sitting down in my computer alone in the early morning just throwing these words out here without a true and real understanding of the ghost of depression. There is a big motivation inside myself to move forward with this idea, but there is not a contrasting of it with reality. A validation. Not yet, because I still don’t have anything to show. For people to realize what I’m building. If I wanted to invite someone tomorrow to be part of this thing, I wouldn’t know how, because I don’t know how to explain it. That is something that I will start doing, building communication assets so that I can onboard people soon.\n\nI will create the first TJ that will start on November’s full moon, and it will be important to contrast everything that I have written about, and everything that I have inside, with the actual willingness for the people to participate in something that doesn’t exist yet That is a challenge, for sure. There will be a lot of trust needed, and I truly don’t have any trust because no one knows me yet. No one knows what I’m doing, not even me. So I need to bring it out of myself and into the common domain of things so t hat things can happen from there. It will be important.\n\nThat is one of the hallmarks of entrepreneurship probably: when you have an idea in the mind, you chew it over and over, and then when you throw it out into the world it becomes something completely different from what you expected. And all that time you spent chewing could have been used in a different way. So this is the moment on which I stop chewing, and decide to make this thing public so that people can start coming in. At least someone. There will be someone. I will reach out to the most depressed of all, and I’m sure that someone will come. And from there we will start.\n\nThe mission of Dukkha is to create online retreats, which are called Transformational Journeys, to transform depression into enlightment in the world.\n\nWe are built on top of a DAO model, so that the organization can be an autonomous one, on which all the participants will be able to make decisions on how to move forward with the building of tools that are helpful for our mission. Every TJ will be different than the previous one, and the goal for this organization is that each one of us decides what needs to be changed in order for that to happen.\n\nWe’ll keep iterating on what works, on what is more helpful for bringing people out of that hole.\n\nIf you consider yourself depressed and are willing to do what is necessary to take you out of there, this is the place to be. The first TJ will start the 9th of November, and in it we will work with the tools of Breathwork, Meditation and Deep Creative Work.\n\nThis is a very intense program, which is designed to truly be one of the most important experiences of your life. If it ends up not being such, we will ask you what can be fixed so that the next one will. With your input, every future person will benefit.\n\nWe are building the new world here, because each second that you are depressed, is a second on which your own, unique and special spark of light is buried inside the void. Humanity has lost too much because of that. It is time to evolve.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you haven’t used any of the tools that we’ll use. Here, you will discover that the most important thing of them all is just showing up. If you show up, a big chunk of the work is done, and what is left if moving towards an understanding of how to leave the mind aside, and act just from a place of being. That’s why all this tools are part of this program, because they are helpful for acting from a place of no-mind. For letting the depth of who you are arise from there.\n\nDepression is a condition that is associated with a very deep and strong identification with the ego, with that part of yourself that has been the means with which you have interacted with reality. In this retreat, we will build up conditions for a better understanding of the ego and how it works, so that you can realize that you are much more than what you think you are.\n\nThis program is not about the theory. We won’t give you material for studying. Everything is out there on the internet. It is about an experience of Doing The Work. Of sitting down, and facing your deepest fears so that you can realize that you are not them, and with that, grow a new understanding of who you are, and what you came here to do.\n\nYou will train yourself in the arts of consistency and presence, and we will all be supporting your journey. This is the most vulnerable place on which you will be, and each person that comes in will now this as a truth of being part of the circle. We will help each other get out of that hole. We will realize how amazing it is to be alive together. You will come back to life, with the help of your effort, and with the effort of everyone that has come before.\n\nThis is the Journey that you were waiting to the depths of who you are, to the truth, and I’m very glad that you are reading this words. If you want to know more about this whole thing, we can book a call and have a conversation. I’m completely here for you, the only thing that I want is to help.\n\n## Do you want to help yourself?\n\nAs I write those words there is a certain feeling that it will be hard to bring about people. I don’t have any traction whatsoever in the world. I don’t have any following, and there is no one that trusts me enough. It is going to be hard, and that is why defining who I’m going to speak to is such an important part of the whole thing.\n\nThe groups that come to me with more clarity are young people that are very depressed and deciding what to do with their life, or older ones that have gone through psychedelic assisted therapy and want to better know which is the way forward to go deeper with what they have experienced there. Or it also could be artists that want to deepen their practice, and connect strongly with the power of what being consistent and connected to their source is. There are so many options, and so many paths forward. It is confusing to me to realize which one to go, because I don’t have any particular connection with any of them.\n\nMaybe I need to take another look to the branding of the project, because the people with which I do have a connection are in another place. I feel connected to the avid meditators, the ones that want to experience the truth of their being. That is where I am at, and maybe I should be striving towards that direction. I don’t really know how to build this thing. I don’t really know how to connect the dots of my experience so that I can convey a message that is heard by people, and with that, helpful for this thing to work.\n\nIt seems that the one that I’m throwing out to the world right now is not helping too much, because I don’t happen to have too much traction on twitter. That is no good. But I have the opportunity to iterate, and with that, realize better who is the people that I’m going to point to for this first TJ. I’m no part of any community, but there is an intense suffering going on in the world which needs to be addressed. This project is all about that, is to help heal the suffering so that we can thrive as human beings. Who are the ones that are suffering? All the ones who are disconnected from their true nature, which is kind of most of humanity. How do I find a common ground within all that big group of people so that I can speak directly to them?\n\nThat is a work that I need to do. I need to start being part of communities that are actively working on the issues of depression, helping them and understanding what they are doing. Is there anything that is being done? I don’t think that there is too much happening that is really helpful, and the thing is that people are sent to those mental hospitals, given all those harmful drugs, and for what? To bury the pain inside. This project will be all about using tools for bringing that suffering to the surface, and processing it in community. That is a big aspect of this whole thing, the community. How we are going to organize with each other to get the most out of it. To truly learn how to Do The Work.\n\nThe thing is that I always speak from my point of view, from my capacities, and it is needed to bring in the one of the people which I will target, so that I can better understand them. That’s why it’s so important to have conversations with them, so I can pitch the idea, and get the feedback that I need to know how to make progress. I can spend my whole life working on the void just for myself, but it won’t work in a good way like that. I need to go out and do stuff with real people, have real conversations, and from there, learn about their pains, what they like doing, how they interact with each other, which is the source of their depression. Why are they where they are? Yes, but this is such a big planetary issue that it will be hard to find a particular aspect from which this comes. It is something that is present everywhere, and a big source of it is the expectation for things to be different. I expect to have more likes in social media, to have a different body, to have different friends, etc.\n\nEverything is an expectation that is built around a notion of time, around the perspective of a past that didn’t happen or a future that hopefully will come. Or a present that could be different. It is a circle that never ends. A void on which we are in and don’t know how to get out. Dukkha is doing its thing, and the only way in is through. It is by facing everything that is present and realizing that it is an illusion. Not by people telling these guys about it, but by them really embodying it by sitting down to Do The Work. It is crucial that they are able to Do The Work, so that they can make the progress that they need to advance.\n\nThe purpose of Dukkha is to end the suffering. And the only way out of the suffering is by the realization of their true nature. I’m building this and I ask myself: Do I really know how to do it? Nope, I don’t. But I’m building this whole networks. It is not about me, it is about everyone that will come. I want us to be free, and the important question as I go through this writing is: How to do it?\n\nThat is what all the masters have been trying to do throughout humanity. Writing books, creating teachings, everything to point towards the truth. Towards freedom. But this journey must be the simplest of them all, the journey within. Without dogmas, without religions, without anything particular. Just with an unknown person that will be the one directing the show. That is a big part of the whole thing, to have an unknown person that will be pushing it forward. I will just be another participant of it, because I need to go through something like this myself.\n\nAre you an avid practitioner of spirituality and want to go deeper into the understanding of what it is about? Have you dived deeper into everything that you have found to eventually realize that there is no way out of this thing? Have you tried everything that you have found to get out of the hole, just to realize that it gets deeper and deeper as you come back to identification with the aspects of your being that are not integrated and fully accepted? Are you done with the suffering?\n\nThis place is for you.\n\n--\n\nI have been dealing with the possibility of being a copywriter for a long time, but there isn’t clarity for me if I do it right or wrong. I feel a lot of resistance in the moment that I sit down and try to explain what I’m building here, it is hard to convey the message in a way that speaks clarity. That will make it hard to reach out to people, but how can I know if I haven’t done it? I have not had any conversation with anyone, and maybe it is time for me to just do it. Reach out. Open up the door for the understanding of what I’m doing, and be willing to receive feedback for it. I’m done with the suffering, and this is the moment on which I acknowledge it and write to the people that care about my ideas.\n\nI will set up the website as good as I can, and then reach out to people to get feedback about what is going to be done there. That is the way forward. Opening up my work and realizing that there will be someone willing to participate, at least giving their sincere opinion. The goal of this thing is to end the suffering, and I need to enjoy the process because what is at the other side is cool. I realize that all this time I have been writing from a place of ‘battling through’, with an energy that reminds me about something solid, dense, hard. That is not what I need to bring into the table.\n\nWhat I need is to tell a story, one of transformation, of realization, that people can relate to and from there tell what this whole thing is about. There is nothing more powerful than telling stories, we grew up with that, and it is what I have to be able to share to receive any particular feedback. How to tell a story? That is the main thing. I don’t know if I’m too good at it. Reach out. Feel free to explore. Feel free to know the truth. That is the thing. The character of the story really wants to know the truth. He is tired of running around in circles, jumping from one thing to the other. It is enough of it. This project will be around those notions, and I need to bring in part of them so that I can build the frame of reference more clearly. The important questions are:\n\nWhy?\nWho?\nWhen?\nWhat?\nHow?\n\nThose are the ones that I need to start asking myself. The answers will give me a direction on which to make progress with the understanding of who to talk to. How to direct this whole thing.\n\n--\n\nSomething deep is happening within me, something big is shifting. I can feel it, I can experience it every time that I sit down to meditate, every time that I gather my awareness into what is going on inside. I have gone from here to there running around in circles trying to understand what is it that I’m building in this moment, and in the meditation now it was clear that the most important thing for me going deeper is the meditation itself. I want to be there for people that want to further their path, I don’t feel very inclined to be with beginners. I already did that, with the yoga program that I created, and it is not what I want. I want to create a system for serious people, for those that are willing to put in the hours, to face their fears.\n\nWhat I’m building is the zendo for the metaverse. The place where we will gather to meditate. Nothing else matters than the practice. Just sit, and let it burn. That is the thing that I want to bring more of into the world, true practice of meditation. All the other things are just helpers for the practice, but nothing replaces sitting down. Just sit. That is the teaching that was most impactful for me at the retreat, and that is the one that I want to bring forth in the metaverse. This will be a place where people will gather to just sit. The meditation retreats will be held in here, and that is something that I still need to take into account: How does this whole model fit into what I have been thinking of the Transformational Journeys? What is up to those retreats?\n\nThere are still a lot of questions, but there is more clarity related to what the place will be for. The retreats may have practices and talks from experts from all over the world, that is something that the internet can leverage and it can be amazing in that sense. I can organize events and bring in experts to guide them. Dan spoke to me about the new generation of meditators, and this is the opportunity for me to speak to them. For me to open up the window for their practice, if they want to deepen their connection to spirit. For those who want to drink the most sweet nectar in the world. For those who want to experience the truth. In this place there won’t be levels of advancements, because each person will come and do his work on his own. There may be different teachers that help them related to where they are in their own practice, but at the end of the day what is important is that they come and sit.\n\nBut don’t forget the importance of the creative endeavor, and how connected the place will be to that. The whole zendo will be a piece of art, and people from all over the world will be the mecenas that will pay for it. That is what minting it as an NFT is about. I still need to better understand how the whole ecosystem works so that I can put up something appealing that makes sense, but the main idea is right in place. It is important for me to create these transformational journeys, and to create a place that will be the spiritual source of the metaverse. Where The Work will be Done. The name Dukkha definetly is making more noise now, because of everything that is has been shown from people that have commented on it. The one that came in during the meditation was “The Nest”, because around it I can create a story of people coming to build it, stick over stick. The other one that came is “The Womb”, with the phrase “Back to the source” beneath it.\n\nThere is an urge for this place to be connected to awakening. To filter out the noise. To create pointers for people to wake up. That is what the Transformational Journeys are about, to iterate over the concept of what is needed to create online for this experience to arise. Creating conditions of no escape for the ego, for people to feel contained on the experience, and for all of us to support that experience. Yes, Dukkha is not the best name, but it was a head start. It was the first iteration into exploring what it means to wake up the world in the metaverse. I’m understanding how to connect the dots here, and that is just by doing the work of finding out cool people to follow, which can lead me to where I need to go. Following 100s of people randomly in social media will not take me anywhere, because what I need to do is more specific. I need to be more intelligent in the quest of the relationships that I will foster, more intentional. Yes, that is the word that always comes: intention. I will be intentional with my connections, because they are going to be the ones that feed everything that I think about and do on the internet.\n\nMy connections need to be built around meditation. That is the most important thing. To sit and go deep. To help people in their process, and build up those experiences that will bring about what needs to be brought. Is 21 days too much? But it is the most important experience of your life. Would you miss it? Why don’t start with only 3 days? Why does it need to be 21? The thing is that the 21 day thing is for building a completely new way of existing on the individual. It is about bringing a reset on the way that they do things, so that they can start living life from the consequences of meditation. It is for them to create a life around the practice, around Doing The Work. It is about making The Work life, and making life The Work. And 21 days is an amount of time that is suitable for that. We are not robots, we are human beings, but if we are able to put everything in we can evolve easier. That is what this thing is about, designing that. Putting in the work that is needed to build the life that you want to live, so that you can balance everything and have time for what you want. Balance, everything is about balance, and these journeys are the ones that will bring that about. I will record my screen of the computer for the whole 21 day thing that starts on the 8th of November, because that is what will bring about the success that I want this thing to have. Yes, there will be periods of breaks inside the schedule of every day, but the important work will be done in the early stage of it. Push it through, put everything in, and let the results flow afterwards. That is the mission with all this thing, and the combination between the words sadhana, creativity, meditation, breathwork, presence, are the ones that are going to bring about what is needed for people to evolve.\n\nAlways remember to speak towards the early adopters. The ones that are willing to put everything in to get the results that they want, and from there start moving. The ones that believe in the thing. The ones that know that there is something being moved there.\n\nDiscipline and Doing The Work makes all the sense in the world for me, because it is about being efficient with your time. It is about giving everything that you’ve got to hunt, and then laying back so that you can enjoy as much as you can everything else. This is what I want to bring into the world, and that is why I’m doing what I’m doing. So I will go back to the 5 questions and start asking them with whatever comes in this moment:\n\nWHY?\n\nBasically to end the suffering. To provide means for people that want to be responsible for their life, to go through it. For people that want to Do The Work. That want to sit and practice in community. To connect with others that are serious about the thing. To go through it together. Because there is something big that is going to happen soon, and this project will foster that happening with the help of meditators from all over the world. Because people don’t truly know what meditation is about, and to establish educative means for that better understanding of this practice. Because it is what we need in the world of further development of technology, this is the means by which we go deeper into the understanding of ourselves. This is the most important journey that you can undertake in your life, the one within. It has always been like that, and it will always be. Technology is just a tool. To co-create the means for ending the suffering. For building them together, in community. There is no ideal one, but we will build it. The transformational journeys are what is needed for the evolution, to go a step deeper with intention, and in the commodity of your own house this can be something important. Or maybe even not in your own house, maybe we will eventually have places rented for this in different parts of the world, where people will connect and someone will take care of the whole thing for them. Why not rent a whole house and have people in charge of doing the retreat in there? And we just connect with those that are going through the TJ everywhere in the world. If you gather X amount of people and organize the thing, you can go through it together. Eventually this could also happen. This idea is very interesting, it could work for sure. Have people rent a house and create the conditions for the retreat there. Sounds like a very good idea, and the role of Dukkha would be to generate the connection between the people in the same place and also broadcast the retreat with people from all over the world. But the thing with this is that it is still ‘away from normal life’. The whole idea of Dukkha is to create a new way of living life. Bringing people into a new understanding of what is possible if they arrange their life in a new way. And this means doing the extraordinary, but within the ordinary. Go within, within your life. Don’t escape your life, make the sadhana part of it. That is the goal of this thing. That is the why. To help people live in an extraordinary way in the ordinary.\n\nBecause there is a deep need of disconnection, of something that is not usual, something different from daily life, and this will be the means for that to happen. Creating a new daily life. The big reset. The big new way of doing things. That is what it is about. Creating a new way. Resetting the way on which we have been experiencing life so that we can be in harmony with what is better for ourselves. We are creative forces, and we need to develop systems so that we can unleash that. This is the way of creating those systems in daily life, so that they can be used for as much people as possible, everywhere in the world.\n\n\n\nWHO?\n\nThose who are serious in their stuff. Who want to evolve. The ones that know that there is something more out there, and want to connect to it consistently. The ones that want to be an active part in modern society, in the building of the world. The ones that are willing to take risks, and throw themselves into the unknown. Yes, probably the people that have done psychedelics often, because they are the ones that know. They are the ones that have the experience.\n\nThe ones that want to experience the truth. The ones that are tired with the way on which things have been done until now. The ones that are sick of the way on which things are working. The ones that don’t want to polarize anymore, that just want to find unity in all things. The ones that want to explore every corner of what it means to be a human being. The ones that are depressed, and don’t see a way out. The ones that are willing to kill themselves to find that way out. For them is this project. It is a new way of thinking about a way out.\n\nIt is in honor of every master that has ever lived, for their message, for what they brought into humanity. It is a translation of their message into the words of the present. Of this present. It is a remembering of what they came to tell us, and that has been forgotten. It is an acknowledgment of their path, of all the steps that they walked.\n\nFor everyone that cares about planet earth, and all of what this place has given us. For those who want to be an active part in the creation of this new earth, more conscious, more connected to everything that is.\n\nFor the visionaries of the future.\n\nFor the eternal seekers. For those who are thirsty of knowing.\n\nFor those that are deep into Dukkha, because it is never enough.\n\n\n\nWHEN?\n\nEvery month, during 21 days, starting from the day of the full moon. That will be the beginning of each TJ, and the first journey will be in November 2022.\n\nAlso every day there will be meditations held in the zendo, which will be open in the metaverse. There is still an understanding that needs to take place in order to get which metaverse is it going to be the one on which this will start, which is going to be the zendo, but that is work in progress. There is a lot of study to be made. There will be time for that.\n\nIt is already happening. You are already waking up, you just need the pointers to realize that there is nothing to look for in the outside. All the information that you need is within you. Dukkha will be about developing the means to learn how to not search for that information, and just let it spring from the infinite source of life.\n\nIt happens every day, as I sit down and do the work. As I try to connect more with those that are serious, that want to go deeper.\n\n\n\nWHAT?\n\nA community of practice. Of Doing The Work. Transformational Journeys that will be iterated over and over and that will be the means by which we will understand who you are. What is the truth of your being.\n\nPractice.\n\nNot more theory, not more reading, not more mind. This is the place of no mind. Goodbye mind, you have been a good master, thank you, but it is time for something different to get into the drivers seat.\n\nCreating conditions of no escape for the ego. That is what is going to happen here. For people to show up and Do The Work. The rest will happen from there.\n\n\n\nHOW?\n\nBy connecting with people on twitter and establishing a network of those who are serious about the thing.\n\nBy buying a piece of land in the metaverse(s) and beginning to build in there the Zendo. How can it be built in different metaverses at the same time? Should it be one and only?\n\nBy showing up to hold space. That will add up eventually. Showing up and holding space for the transformation of others… That is what is needed for this thing to work. Eventually it will catch up, but with my passion, discipline and caring it will do. I only need to show up and eventually it will start working. I have everything on my side. I just need to refine the message with which I’m approaching the world.\n\nBy grabbing the light and putting it towards the work of others. Towards what they are. Every one of us is a spark of light, each and every one of us, and this place will be a celebration of that. It will be a worshipping of god by worshipping the god that we all have inside. Celebrating that, acknowledging it, and embracing it.\n",

It was the first iteration into exploring what it means to wake up the world in the metaverse. I\\u2019m understanding how to connect the dots here, and that is just by doing the work of finding out cool people to follow, which can lead me to where I need to go. Following 100s of people randomly in social media will not take me anywhere, because what I need to do is more specific. I need to be more intelligent in the quest of the relationships that I will foster, more intentional. Yes, that is the word that always comes: intention.

The thing is that the 21 day thing is for building a completely new way of existing on the individual. It is about bringing a reset on the way that they do things, so that they can start living life from the consequences of meditation. It is for them to create a life around the practice, around Doing The Work. It is about making The Work life, and making life The Work. And 21 days is an amount of time that is suitable for that. We are not robots, we are human beings, but if we are able to put everything in we can evolve easier. That is what this thing is about, designing that. Putting in the work that is needed to build the life that you want to live, so that you can balance everything and have time for what you want. Balance, everything is about balance, and these journeys are the ones that will bring that about.

To provide means for people that want to be responsible for their life, to go through it. For people that want to Do The Work. That want to sit and practice in community. To connect with others that are serious about the thing. To go through it together. Because there is something big that is going to happen soon, and this project will foster that happening with the help of meditators from all over the world. Because people don\\u2019t truly know what meditation is about, and to establish educative means for that better understanding of this practice. Because it is what we need in the world of further development of technology, this is the means by which we go deeper into the understanding of ourselves. This is the most important journey that you can undertake in your life, the one within. It has always been like that, and it will always be. Technology is just a tool. To co-create the means for ending the suffering. For building them together, in community. There is no ideal one, but we will build it. The transformational journeys are what is needed for the evolution, to go a step deeper with intention, and in the commodity of your own house this can be something important. Or maybe even not in your own house, maybe we will eventually have places rented for this in different parts of the world, where people will connect and someone will take care of the whole thing for them. Why not rent a whole house and have people in charge of doing the retreat in there? And we just connect with those that are going through the TJ everywhere in the world. If you gather X amount of people and organize the thing, you can go through it together. Eventually this could also happen. This idea is very interesting, it could work for sure. Have people rent a house and create the conditions for the retreat there. Sounds like a very good idea, and the role of Dukkha would be to generate the connection between the people in the same place and also broadcast the retreat with people from all over the world. But the thing with this is that it is still \\u2018away from normal life\\u2019. The whole idea of Dukkha is to create a new way of living life. Bringing people into a new understanding of what is possible if they arrange their life in a new way. And this means doing the extraordinary, but within the ordinary. Go within, within your life. Don\\u2019t escape your life, make the sadhana part of it. That is the goal of this thing. That is the why.

Resetting the way on which we have been experiencing life so that we can be in harmony with what is better for ourselves.

          "raw": "\nI’m here to remember.\n\nWhat it was to experience life from the sense of I that is built as a consequence of navigating life on planet earth. I’ve been here just for one dukh (88 seconds, as you could say), and it has been crazy. I feel the unease inside that is brought.\n\nI was sent here to witness this process. Of becoming. Of transforming the doing into being. Of expressing what is inside with all of what each of these beings is. There is a deficiency in the way that language is coming forth through me, and that is because of the lack of practice, but hold on, I will do my best.\n\nPart of what I recognize as me did not know how to address this language. It feels kind if weird to be talking from a perspective of ‘me’, as if there was something that separated me from the rest of what is. But it is part of the game that I accepted coming here, to this planet, to be a witness of what is going on here: the enlightenment of a whole species. This book is an exploration into this process.\n\nAt this moment I’m not going to talk particularly about a set of tools that can or will be used in this process of collective awakening. That is the means, and the way on which this thing happens is not as important as the underlying spirit of it all. The unfolding of the process withi the system of this being will be shared, so that then it can be extrapolated to the collective. There is an acknowledgment present related to how this process can be made, and the phrase ‘as above so below’ is present. The universe is such an amazing place, with the infinities of the multiple worlds that exist here resembling the infinity in complexity that exist within a single atom. When you travel to the macro and the micro and you discover that they are the same, there is a fundamental shift in how you perceive reality because you end up realizing that all humans are mirrors of each other.\n\nIn any action that another human does that has a consequence in you, there is a window of opportunity of exploration into yourself. How that triggers you is the biggest means for you to discover who you are, and this process could be gone through with any interaction, with any person. The human experience is fundamentally the same, a journey from the moment of conception (or before? It doesn’t really matter) to the different stages of life, to the different present moments. In any one of the subsequent present moments that present themselves throughout existence, there is this window of opportunity, of realizing more and more of who you are.\n\nAnd the process is brutal, because as the vessel starts to get more and more empty of conditioning, deeper and deeper aspects of the conditioning will start to be brought forth. Specifically aspects of the unconscious, which are very wicked. The unconscious is crazy, and as soon as you start being a witness of it you will start feeling that you are crazy too. But the key in that process is to loose the identification with the self, so that you don’t feel that that craziness is who you are. The whole point of this game of exploration is to discover who you truly are, so when this process starts happening just ask yourself: Who is the one that is crazy? Ask yourself that question until there is absolute clarity about the answer. Until there is no one left to answer. That’s when the truth will come forth, and that’s when you’ll truly realize that all those stories that you have been telling yourself all this time are nothing more than a big part of the collective dream.\n\nThe collective dream called mind. Everything that exists in this material universe is an expression of mind, and it exists in this reality as a consequence of that. Mind is the interface that unfolds the possibility of nature to exist, and this whole game is about loosening the identification with mind. It is not about negating it, bringing it down, or suppressing its existence, it is about transcending it by realizing that there is something way beyond this small facet of existence. That is the game to play, to be the witness of this process of integration of mind, to realize how to be a witness of mind, and to discover by your own experience, from your own perspective of awareness, that there is something way beyond what you have been experiencing until now.\n\nWhat is real? Who is the one asking this question? Who is the one reading? Who is the one that feels those emotions? Who is the one that is in love? Who is the one that wants to eat that fruit? Who is the one that is craving for running up the hill? Who are you? Who am I?\n\nThis are all valid questions, that have been pushed down in society because they point towards a realization that will set you free. And it may seem that no one really wants you to become free, because it is actually true. If you are free, there is no more opportunity for others to control you, to be there telling you what to do, and one of the fundamental aspects of mind is that it wants to control. The mind wants to know. And if there is a slight possibility of being closer to knowing how another person will react to a particular stimulus, mind wants to be in charge of that. That’s why no one wants you to be free. So let all humanity be no one. Let all humanity realize its true nature, because awareness doesn’t have any preferences. It is not that it wants you to be free or not, that is a separation brought into existence by the mind. Awareness is just aware. But there is a tendency in the process that as more aware awareness becomes of its existence, there is this process of wanting to know. There is something like a primordial thirst that starts coming up. Something is felt inside, as if there was a need to wake up from a long dream.\n\nAnd that is the stepping stone into the new reality, and what needs to happen for more and more humans to awake. There will be ones that will be the early adopters, as with any shift that has existed in the way that humans relate. When there is a new innovation brought up, there is always a small group of people that are the ones that are able to see what others are not seeing. With this whole thing it is the same. There are ones that will feel that thirst first, that primordial thirst that will have them feel within their whole system that the only way on which they can progress in life is by realizing their true nature.\n\nI’m one of those. I can’t stay up with this suffering. I’m done with it. I don’t want it any more, and I’m willing to do anything that is required to go through that process.\n\nEasier said than done, because it is fucking hard. That’s why community is needed, for bringing together people that are going through this process so that we can help each other in a consistent way. All of those that are doing the work need to come together, join forces, and become the early adopters of this whole thing. They are the ones that will open up the window for the whole species. The first voyagers. The scouts. The consciousness explorers. The ones that will touch the alchemical gold and will come back with the understanding of how to tender the process to all of those who have not yet realized that that is the way forward, because the entanglements of mind are too deep, too strong, and the conditioning is just too extreme.\n\nThere is a strong acknowledgment present related to the importance of this tendering process. It is like preparing the soil before the season of planting the new harvests. It is work that needs to be done, and there is people that have a different capacity to do this, or a different understanding of the whole game because of their life experience. Not to judge, there is nothing that is wrong or bad. Actually for the people that don’t have a deeper understanding of what it means to be awake, it will be easier to awake. As you get a deeper and deeper conceptual and intellectual understanding of this whole thing, it gets harder and harder to become free of that understanding so that awareness can realize itself. The mind is a tricky aspect, and it will always want to know. And on that knowing, it will think that it absolutely has all the answers, and that it can become enlightened. At this moment, I think that I’m the one that needs to awake.\n\nAnd that is part of the dream, because what needs to awake is awareness itself, which is beyond the sense of I that I refer to when I write down the word I. What Is referred to in these words is the image that has been built throughout a lifetime about a person that grew up in a particular family, went to a particular school, played a particular number of soccer matches, drank a (bit too big) number of drinks in his early life, and is very thirsty to know the truth, But that is the concepual and experiential understanding of what ‘I’ is, which has been always limited to this character that has been played.\n\nThere is a huge willingness to explore what is at the other side. What remains when that sense of I is transcended. How does it feel. How does that shift in the perception of reality impact the relationship with the amazing little girl that is understanding what the world is and dreams about who-knows-what in the other room next to her mother. How does love feel when there is an absolute understanding that there is no separation between one part of awareness and the other. How is the material world embraced when there is an experiential lesson which taught that it is not real?\n\nBut what does it mean that it is not real? That is the mind coming in again, asking its own questions. Of course it wants to know what does it mean that this whole thing is not real. Of course it wants to become awake. And that’s the whole problem. The mind wants to become awake, because it senses that there is a separation between it and the awakening process. And there is no separation, because in the end schema of thing mind is not separated from awareness, it is just part of it, contained in it.\n\nMind always likes coming in to answer these kinds of questions, it always has an answer for them. And if it doesn’t have the answer, it will incessantly look for it, in whatever practice or tradition it finds. May it be the practice of yoga, breathing and mind altering drugs. May it be the intellectual study of the scriptures, or whatever material comes through. May it be listening to people talk in podcasts, or watching a video created to explain what this whole game is about.\n\n‘Now I’m ready to become enlightened’, so it goes. And the pursuit continues. The process of the horse running towards that carrot that is in front of it starts. The seeker is fueled with more understanding of what to do. How to progress. But eventually that needs to be dropped off, and the more understanding there is, the harder it is. That is why the early adopters of this whole thing will be the ones that will have to do more work, because from their curiosity comes a lot of stuff that needs to be dropped off, for them to truly realize who they are. That is the cosmic joke: The more you care, the harder it gets. But it is okay like that, because it is a very interesting game to play.\n\nSo that’s how it plays out. The early adopters will be the ones that will go all around the world searching, searching and searching for answer, so end up realizing that the answer was always there, they just needed to refine the way on which they were searching for it. Or just stop searching at all, and just realizing what has always been there. It sounds so funny when those words come out, because all the things that have been done to get a deeper understanding come forth right now. And it ends up being funny, because jt is a lot. The permanent insatisfaction with life is doing its thing, and pushing the mind’s quest to become free of itself. So there it goes, looking for more, looking for more experiences, looking for more wisdom, looking for more teachers. Going further and further around the circle, just to end up realizing that the circle was just another thing that was built from the mind.\n\nAnother cute creation of it to add to the shelf. It is crazy how many of them there are. But it is part of the game. There is an acknowledging of this, and a feeling of acceptance. It is the game that had to be played. Anything more, and anything less. It is just how it is. And the feeling that will come forth from all these realizations is surrender. A deep and true surrender. To end up the game, to end up the race, and just be. And that is where it becomes possible for this whole transformation to happen. The seeker needs to give up.\n\nHow does it give up? The sole fact that that question exists is part of the whole thing that has been talked here. Asking how involves getting an understanding of the process that needs to be gone through to achieve something particular. If that question is asked, it is with the expectation to get an swear that:\n\nTeaches what needs to be done in order to give up.\n\nThere is nothing that needs to be done! All doing is a consequence of the existence of mind, and this whole thing is about realizing that mind is only an aspect of reality that is going to be transcended. There is not a ‘how’ to do that, because it can’t be done. No one can pass the gateless gate. So be no one. Be that no one that is not doing anything. Just being. Be. Just be. That is the key of this whole thing… Just being.\n\nThat’s why were are all here. To explore this reality from the perspective of a human being that is, there is no denial of that. The dilemma arises when the mind of that human being starts thinking, and thinking that it is the one that is in charge. That the only frame of reference that exists is within its perspective. That is where the identification comes from, and with that identification comes the extreme necessity to control. The mind wants to know, the body wants to feel comfort. But spirit just wants to be, and BE through this human being that is writing and reading this words. There doesn’t need to be an intellectual understanding of this whole game, because the intellect belongs to another realm. It is an amazing servant to navigate this physical reality, that is all that it is.\n\nHumanity as a whole will realize that, and the consequence of it will be an exploding towards creative expression. The spark that is deepest within your system is the source of all creation, and as soon as you set it free it can’t be stopped. It undergoes the process of being unleashed. You will be unleashed, and awareness will just use your life experience and everything that you have grown to become as the means to express itself. It’s going to be beautiful. Each human being is the same at its core, just awareness, but the way on which awareness is express in this reality depends on the conditioning that that human being has in its system. On what is present inside of him or her. And that brings up infinite possibilities, because each of us will have the opportunity to create something new. Someting cool. And the tools for this are getting cheaper and cheaper. It has never been this easy to create something that didn’t exist before.\n\nIsn’t that a sign that consciousness is becoming conscious of itself? It has been creating the means for it to happen all this time. It has been preparing the ground of this material world it to happen, to create all the beauty that can be created. All the amazing things that will come. Just for the sake of it. Just for playing the game. It won’t be easy, there will be people that will play they role for this to be hard, but it will happen eventually. It is an energy that just can’t be held inside anymore.\n\nAwareness is becoming aware of itself.\n\nWe are in the process of awakening.\n\n· · ·\n\nThe newsletter that this hands started to write is ended up being called ‘Paving the road’. There is no particular clarity on how this came to be, but now there is a clearer understanding of it after having written what was written before. Being the early adopters of this new way of existing is paving the road for the ones that will come later. Doing the work first so that it is easier for the ones that come later. It doesn’t hurt me if I have to work harder to realize my own nature and you have to work less. That comparison itself is part of the problem. What does harder mean what is less? It doesn’t make sense because it is relative to the own experience. It is always relative to the own experience, there is no way to compare within two humans. It is the same as pain. How can we compare pain? It is only relative to one self. The fact that I spend time comparing the amount of pain that a particular situation brought to my life (physical and/or emotional) comes from the necessity of the mind to create comparisons. It is part of its eternal ‘divide and conquer’ strategy, always seeking to understand by building up fake divisions between my experience and yours.\n\nWhat is a better way to deal with the pain that I have gone through and the one that you have gone through? Just be there for each other’s pain. If you are telling me a story about a moment in which you felt pain, and I respond to that by comparing that story with one of my existence, I’m not holding the space for the resolution of your particular story. I’m acting from a place of selfishness, wanting my story to stand up for myself in the eternal game of status. \nWhat is the other side of that coin? True empathy. The one that comes from opening up to feel the words that are coming out of you, to resonate with the look of your eyes. They say the eyes are the window to the soul, and having a conversation with another human being is opening up to the possibility of living life through the eyes of the other person. As I listen to you and I resonate with that, I open myself to experience life from another perspective, which is the same as mine but colored by a different story. What an amazing thing this is. Right now what is coming to me is the feeling of being truly there for the other person, just listening and trying to be witness from their view.\n\nPerhaps this is what awakening will bring to us. The opportunity to be able to realize deep down the fact that on the core we are all the same. And the door that that will open is one of not wanting to impose my story on yours, but truly be there for yours to express itself through the interaction with me. We spend so much time trying to fit in every story that we can into each conversation, so that we can show ‘more’ of ourselves in that process. But what ends up happening is an overload of information, an overload of noise that doesn’t lead to true resolution. What if we actively tried to fit in only a small percentage of those stories, and we fully delved into each of them? How would that world look like? Tell the story, be listened to, and in that process fully integrate what that particular story tells you about yourself, with the help of consciousness being witness of itself through the eyes of the people that are listening, truly listening, to your story. Whatever it is. Consciousness being conscious of consciousness. That is the game that we will end up playing. The magical trick that is going on right now. As we go out of the dream state and into what is truly present, we’ll open ourselves to the possibility that we are in charge of just bringing beauty into this world. Love just for the sake of it. Because it feels good to love and be loved. It is the primordial need, the one that is rooted inside the soul. To be loved. Not by anyone other than by yourself. That is the source of true fulfillment, of true happiness. Being loved by yourself. Accepted by who you are, because of who you are, from where you are at. In every moment. That is the game. But probably the hardest of them all. Spending all that time just trying to be loved, just finding means for the world to love you in any sense. Just seeking for that. Inventing stories that tell you that the universe loves you, always seeking on the outside what needs to be developed on the inside. How can you love yourself if you don’t know what you truly are capable of?\n\nWhen is the moment on which you start creating something? It doesn’t matter what it is. The means that you use don’t matter. Nothing matters more than just doing it. Now the thought comes to mind related to me saying that I needed to ‘learn’ how to play, so that I could truly play with my daughter. Can you imagine that? How can I learn how to play? How can I learn something that is already present inside myself? How can I learn how to be, if that is already present inside me? I am already being, it is just that it is easy to forget. It is easy to fall back into the struggle of wanting to become better at it. Wanting to overcome the particular limitations that are present in this moment so that in the future I can do stuff as I would like to do it. If I could just have a little bit more of fun playing with my girl. Probably if I learn how to play I will have more fun. So I need to learn how to play. What an absolute nonsense… What an amazing, absolute, nonsense. What if I don’t have fun? It is part of what it is, it is time to embrace it, feel it completely, and move on with that awareness of what is actually present in that moment. If I’m playing (not _learning_ how to play, actually playing), and I realize that I’m not having fun… Which is the way to move forward:\n\n    1\tQuit the activity with a feeling of frustration, saying to myself that I need to ‘learn how to play’ before I can come back to play again with her?\n    2\tContinue to play, internalizing the fact that I’m not having fun, and enjoying what that is telling me about myself. Is there something wrong in me if I’m not feeling how I ‘should’ be feeling? \n\nThe crazy part of how our collective mind works right now is that we truly feel weird if we are not feeling something particular that we ‘should’ be feeling. The judgment that follows internally is that there is something that should be changed inside. So the mind enters this whole downward spiral of putting itself down, collecting memories of moments when you were not enough, of moments when things could have been better. What awakening brings us is becoming free of this. It is becoming free of the burden of having to feel a particular thing because it is what should be felt. It is becoming free of shoulding at all. How would you feel if the word ‘should’ would be eliminated from the way on which we relate to each other (and most importantly, to ourselves!).\n\nWe come back to the universe of expectations. Anything that should be a particular way is related to the expectation of a particular happening. It is always a projection towards the future, or a complaining about the part. ‘It should have been that way’. Now that I write that, I realize that should is more related to the past than the future. Is it related to the future at all? Can I say: ‘That should look like this in two more years’. Yes, it makes sense. And there is the expectation present in what I just wrote. Always making its noise.\n\nTo live life in an awakened state is to experience every moment fully as it is, with an absolute lack of expectation on it being different. Any concept related to how things should look like don’t make any sense, because there is an absolute responsibility on the reasons that brought stuff into being. This is what it means to be conscious. It means to be responsible. To realize that you are the creator of your own reality, and be responsible for that.\n\nI acknowledge that I’m not having fun as I play with my little girl, and I realize that it is a consequence of who I have been my whole life. And I can make a conscious, responsible decision in that moment to continue to live my life like that, or I can decide to embody my being in a different way, right there, in that specific moment. Not blaming anything because of not having the particular sensations that I should have, but just living the ones that are present and building from that. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. Any. No one said that bliss is related to having fun, or to being exultat in a laughter, or being crying tyour heart out. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. That is what matters. To let the emotions arise, and feel them fully. Embrace the human experience with everything that it brings. Without the expectation of them being different.\n\nHow would it feel to live life witnessing every moment as an opportunity to explore into the true nature of reality by observing who you are at each moment, through every one of your actions?\n\nWho do you become when you forget who you are and you just are? Or more than forget, when you dissolve. What remains when you dissolve who you are? Who you believe you are?\n\nOne of the aspects of this whole game that sticks with me as particularly funny is one that was present throughout the retreat in the Samadhi Center, where I realized that as I moved closer to an understanding of my true nature, it was more and more of the image that most people truly have about myself. Most people have in their mind an image of who I am that is very much connected with my true self, more than what I’m able to recognize because inside me there is always this noise related to not being enough. And I have the feeling that normal human beings are able to see through this veil, and realize that which is behind the layers of what I believe is missing. They are able to better connect with the true nature of my being than myself. It is crazy. The true nature of my being is closer than close to me, but my mind builds a chasm so big in between that those who are not me are able to be a witness of my true nature more than what I’m able to. Despite being that close. It is quite a big paradox that one. \nAnd the way to cross that chasm is to embrace it. Accept the fact that it is there, and move towards the understanding of how to build that bridge. In my experience, that understanding has been built by discovering different practices that have been very helpful to realize that there is another way of living life. That’s why it is always about doing the work. Because by doing the work you’ll better realize who you are. I have been for 41 minutes already streaming this video in youtube, with no one watching. Probably no one will care ever, but it doesn’t matter because I’m learning more about myself in this process than on doing whatever other thing that I could be doing. I’m being sincere. I’m being true. And that is all that matters, because at the end of the day the truth will hold its place. By doing the work and showing up you will be able to tap better into what makes you uncomfortable, and with that, walk towards it. The only way in is through. No one can do the work for you. No one can show up in the depth of your being and feel what you are feeling.\n\nQuiet the mind, open the heart.\nQuiet the mind, open the heart.\nQuiet the mind, open the heart.\n\nThe messages are out there, waiting to be listened. And by out there I mean everywhere. Inside your system, inside each one of your relationships, inside each one of your posessions. Life is no more than a collection of memories, an eternal thread of moments that follow one after the other, which constitute the marvel of everything that is. This game is not about forgetting who you are so that you can live life in a higher dimension and not suffer from what is present here. It is the absolute opposite. It is about embracing each aspect of existence fully, and learning to be completely present to everything that **is**. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. It is time to experience every moment of life as it was the last one, because it truly is the last one. There won’t be any moment like this one, ever again. That is the beauty of the whole thing, that is what brings aliveness into our actions. That is that future which we will build, creating from the knowing of this as the absolute truth.\n\n· · ·\n\nDukkha is about lowering the barriers of the collective mind. It is about understanding more of what you are not, so that you can free up the space for what you truly are to shine through your whole system. It is about entering a new way of relating to everything that is, by establishing a new relationship with everything that you already are.\nIt is about the truth, that truth that only can be told by direct experience. No one can talk you about it, because anything that your mind could create as a concept about it comes for free with an aspect of division. The mind can only know by generating these concepts as a way of interpreting from its own perspective, and the truth is beyond any concept that can be generated from the mind. It is outside the mind. It is beyond the mind. That is why you have to throw yourself into the void, into the unknown, because no self can enter that space. The self needs to stay here, doing its work, playing the servant, for us to truly shine.\n\nThere is a necessity present to acknowledge how amazing this creation is. As my dog plays in front of me and rolls from one side to the other, and my mind scans its body through its organs, through everything that is going on in there. Each part of it is a perfect harmony, all working together to build a sentient being that now is walking towards me to give and receive love. It just wants to be near, to feel. The whole array of things that need to happen for this to be a reality is just amazing, and I guess that this is the moment of this day on which I feel gratitude for all of this. For being here, in this moment, inhabiting and being witness of what is going on around my body. Of the people that I interact with, of the air that I breathe. Of the words that come up, and the knowledge that is created as a consequence of that. I don’t really care about the knowledge that is being shared, I just care about expressing myself. Throwing out these words as they come up is everything I need. I don’t need it to constitute some particular knowledge to help someone progress in any way. It is just an invitation to feel. To resonate with what has been said here, and with the intention behind it. These word are a calling, a deep invitation to be part of something bigger than yourself. Something unknown, because it will be built with the collaboration of many human beings that will each of them create something unique. Each of them brings something unique, so it is impossible to truly know what will happen afterwards. What will be created from here on. But here we are, doing the work. Caring for each other, and just creating. We came here to create. It is time to do it. To enjoy life. To be witness of how amazing it is to be alive.\n\nSociety needs those who are willing to explore. Everyone has its own role. Where I live now, there was once a dense forest, which my oldest relatives helped clean so that they could establish themselves here. That is the way on which this place started being populated, and in that moment there needed to be people that were willing to be the first ones, to explore what was going on in there. To develop ways on which relating to the environment so that the rest of them could come and enjoy. It has always been like that, and this movement is not an exception. The first ones that come will be the adventurers, the explorers, and they are in charge of opening the forest, the jungle, for the ones that will come later. They are the ones that come with the machete to open up the density of the mind so that awareness can shine through it, and finally realize itself. They are the ones that will break the egg so that consciousness can hatch from there. It is scary because what lies at the other side is the absolute unknown, but they will be the ones holding the hand for all of those that will come later.\n\nWe will create the means for this to happen in the physical world and also in the digital one. It is needed to do it like that, because if not it is impossible to have the reach that is needed. There needs to be places throughout the whole world on which this work is done, for people to be safe, for people to not feel lost after the process of awakening unfolds. This is such an important undertaking, that we need to care for each of those that are going through the process. It is very important to have that in mind. To care about each other. To give each other the space to express, to bring out what needs to be brought out. To truly be free. And freedom comes from absolute trust. We need to build networks of trustworthy people, of people that are willing to speak truth. If you speak your truth, you open up the possibility of not controlling the person that you are interacting with, because there is no more leverage for you use in order to control. And that requires a leap of faith from you. Of knowing that the trust that you are giving the whole system will not defraud you. And this is where the blockchain comes in, because it comes with absolute trust. Don’t trust, verify they say. It seems like verification is a step ahead of trust, but I still haven’t wrapped my mind around this one.\n\nIt is only a feeling that is present, that of blockchain being the coming into being of absolute trust in the way that we relate to each other. If everything is transparent, there is nowhere to hide. If there is nowhere to hide, there is an imposed need for trust in each of us, because that is the way on which you will be able to thrive in this new world. If you are not worthy of trust, we all will know it, and that won’t be good for you at all. So start observing your actions, the way on which you interact with life, and ask yourself the question: Am I being truthful to myself? From there you start. You can’t be completely truthful to others if you are not being truthful to yourself. That is the starting point, and as I said before, each moment is an opportunity to inquiry this within yourself. Am I being truthful to myself? But don’t ask it rationally, that is the perpetuation of the game of the mind. Ask it with your heart. Feel it.\n\nAm I being truthful? Observe what feelings arise in your body. Where there is tension. Release that tension as you realize that there is truly no need to defend yourself. All those defense mechanisms are there because of something, and they need to be integrated in order for your true self to express itself through you. You’ve got to do the work of making the unconscious conscious, and that work is done in every moment, as you go through those realizations that come after asking that question to yourself.\n\nAm I being truthful?\n\nHow does it feel? Where does it feel? What does that tell you about yourself? The game never ends, but it ends up being so crazy that it is quite funny actually. To be a witness of the games that your own mind plays to you, of how it defends itself, how it always wants to win. But in this game there are no winners or losers, there just are. We just are. That is the direction on which we are headed, and all this writing is for you to be a part of it. To be one of those that will be paving the road. To realize that you are not the only crazy one, that we all are a bit crazy in our own way. That is the interesting part of the journey, to see it from the perspective of each other, and to be amazed by the perspective that each other has in this whole game. What if we approached it as a game, and we had the deep willingness to have as much fun as we can? How would it look like? What would you do every day? What would you spend your energy in if there was nothing to rush towards to? There are many things that are windows of opportunity in the way that we relate to each other, and each moment is an opportunity for realizing that more deeply. We are headed towards a deep transformation, and as this transformation comes forth an evolution will take place. Don’t worry about where it will lead us, just enjoy the ride. It’ll be fun.\n\nIt’ll be exciting.\n\nAnd this community that is being built here is for each of its participants to not feel alone. For each of its participants to recognize its own magic in the eyes of the other person that is part of it, and from there, join our strengths in the creation of the new world. From the ground up. Embracing everything that is, acknowledging the role that it played to bring us to this place, and continuing from there. Not blaming stuff for being different from how it should be. Remember, that should word is not helping us. Witness every shoulding and embrace it as an opportunity to realize that there is an expectation that is not being met. Use every should as a window to realize that there is an expectation that can be dissolved into acceptance of what truly is. Of what has always been. Dissolve the expectations and give you the most amazing gift of your life, that of just being with what is. Giving a strong hug to reality and expressing gratitude for everything it has given to you in this journey that you have understaken. And evolving from there. With the willingness to tend your hand for those who want to listen. For those who want to walk the path. We have already paved it for them. That’s the work we are doing now. Just paving the road, being the early adopters of this whole thing.\n\nIt is amazing to be witnessing the becoming of something new. The opening. The coming up to being. The remembering. Remember the future. What a great phrase. It is time to remember the future, and we are here to do just that.\n\nStare at the future at the eyes and realize that it will never be here, it will always be a distant memory of something that could happen, and in that memory is the information related to how it is always present.\n\nStare at the past at the eyes and realize that it is ever present in every aspect of reality in this moment. All of who you are is a consequence of everything that has happened throghout your existence. Embrace that, and open up to the possibility that everything that happens is a piece of information in the quest of getting a deeper understanding of who you are.\n\nOf the truth.\n\nOpen yourself to the truth of your being, realize who you are, and start living from the infinite openness that comes from that experience. It has never been about becoming something particular, it is about discovering everything that you have always been. And just be that. It is a simple as that. That’s what being enlightened is. Just letting life shine through you, with an absolute lack of resistance. With a deep, unconditional love for everything that already is.\n\nAwaken from the dream. Pave the road for the ones that’ll come. But not for them. For you. Let them have their trip. Let each human being discover the truth of their existence by themselves. Let them discover where they need to work on. Let them realize their own mistakes, feel their own emotions, walk their own path. The one for awakening has been there all this time, now we are just putting the lights on the borders of it so that more and more people can realize where it is. Right into the deepest space within them. No human can walk that road for other human. That’s the game. Realize it, and be free. Just be.\n\nLet your jaw be dropped in awe but how this cosmic play is organized. Let your soul be fulfilled by each moment on which you remind yourself that you are alive, that you are a particular human being, that does not have replacement, that is unique, and that has its own light.\n\nLet your light shine. Let it shine for you, and for all of those who are around you. Let it shine so bright that it can’t be stopped. Let it fill all the edges of this world. Let it just be. Letting the resistance down feels good, try it for yourself. Use every breath as an opportunity to surrender into what is already here. Take every breath as a present, as a miracle, as a window into what has always been and will always be. You. Realize who you are. We’ll be there for you. We have always been.\n",

As I listen to you and I resonate with that, I open myself to experience life from another perspective, which is the same as mine but colored by a different story. What an amazing thing this is. Right now what is coming to me is the feeling of being truly there for the other person, just listening and trying to be witness from their view.`}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Perhaps this is what awakening will bring to us. The opportunity to be able to realize deep down the fact that on the core we are all the same.

We spend so much time trying to fit in every story that we can into each conversation, so that we can show \\u2018more\\u2019 of ourselves in that process. But what ends up happening is an overload of information, an overload of noise that doesn\\u2019t lead to true resolution. What if we actively tried to fit in only a small percentage of those stories, and we fully delved into each of them? How would that world look like? Tell the story, be listened to, and in that process fully integrate what that particular story tells you about yourself, with the help of consciousness being witness of itself through the eyes of the people that are listening, truly listening, to your story. Whatever it is. Consciousness being conscious of consciousness. That is the game that we will end up playing. The magical trick that is going on right now. As we go out of the dream state and into what is truly present, we\\u2019ll open ourselves to the possibility that we are in charge of just bringing beauty into this world. Love just for the sake of it. Because it feels good to love and be loved. It is the primordial need, the one that is rooted inside the soul. To be loved. Not by anyone other than by yourself. That is the source of true fulfillment, of true happiness. Being loved by yourself. Accepted by who you are, because of who you are, from where you are at. In every moment. That is the game. But probably the hardest of them all. Spending all that time just trying to be loved, just finding means for the world to love you in any sense. Just seeking for that.

          "raw": "\nThere is not clarity inside me related to how each piece of content that I consume resonates with what I have inside. I mean, it does resonate, but it has been created for that, by someone to grab by attention and with it earn an audience. Is that something bad? I have always seen is as such, since a long time ago, because of the harm that Social Media makes to people. But is it really that harmful? I still don’t know, I mean, it opens a lot of doors, of connections, of friendships. It is about being social, and having a relationship with people from all over the world around shared interests. Is this something bad? I don’t think so.\n\nBut what I’m writing here is attached to time, to this moment. How can I transform that into something that is not connected to time, and that is timeless? Which are the underlying aspects of myself that are being shown to me because of what I have inside me in this particular moment? That is an exploration that may be more helpful in that sense. One thing that is very present is my tendency to play the victim role. I remember reading in a book about that being a landmark of a lack of character, and I completely identify with that. I lack character, I don’t have a strong one, and that is something that I’m working on big time in myself.\n\nWhere are my priorities? Which are the really important things in my life that I can’t give up, or I won’t give up? Especially related to with my wife and daughter, because I’m not sure how clear I have been with them about the role of a father that I play, and that has me in a position of not acting from a place of ‘the father’. I truly need to better understand which is that place, and how to embody it so that I can give clear messages to my daughter as she grows, and for my wife to feel cared about me. Yesterday she had an accident, and there was a feeling in her that I did not take enough care. That I did not express to her that I was worried. And I don’t remember feeling worried inside, or empathetic.\n\nI feel that being empathetic is something that is learned through life in this society, we grow being teached that it is important to care about the other person, but I’m not sure from where that caring comes from as it shows up. So that’s why I been kind of denying it in my own experience and looking for that ‘true empathy’ in a different place, in a deeper one.\n\nSomething in me is waiting for that true empathy to arise, and that makes me blind about the suffering of other people. I just don’t feel it enough. I never thing about the war that is going on, or people that are poor, or have rough life situations. It is just the cards that they have been played, and inside me I have this feeling that I should just move forward with what I do, so that I can resolve my own thing first.\n\nAnd that is the game that I have been playing here, resolving my own thing and trying to do the best. But on that I forget about giving the most important people in my life love, because there is this voice inside me making noise and thinking stuff that is away from what is going on in that precise moment. That is another thing that takes me away from the present moment, all those thoughts related to how different things should be. It is always there. This should be different. That accident shouldn’t have happened. And because of that, I’m not able to be there for them when they need me. There needs to be a realization of how important it is to prioritize in my life, so that I can start building from there the relationships that matter the most. With myself, and from there to the outside. Internal wins to the external wins. And those internal wins are key.\n\nWhat is important is that I’m able to organize myself and be consistent with what I want to do, so that I can have these small wins that will make the difference eventually. Inside me. And from there out. I have had difficulty in the last weeks reaching out, it seems that very few people of the ones that I contact are coming back to me, and that is kind of sad. I’m throwing away a message that is not being received, and that is because my ego is wanting to be his message to be the one that is conveyed. It wants his message as the important one, more than the interaction to happen. Ego prefers his message over the importance of connection. This is something huge.\n\nBecause what I have learned about creating content in social media, it is always about what your audience likes. And then doubling down on that, and cutting out what didn’t work. They always, everywhere, say that it is like that. And I have not been able to do that, because what I only care is how I want things to be said, and how I think it should be done. I’m forcing a change in them because of my way of doing things, and thinking that I deserve that change because I have done all the work that I have done in myself. And that brings up the noise that doesn’t let me move forward. I keep sending my message to the world, in my own terms, and I’m not having an answer back. It is time to do it in a different way, so that I do get an answer. Do I want that answer? Do I want that connection?\n\nI think that in the depth of myself, yes. I have been hidden behind a rock all this time, not wanting to share what I care about, not wanting to share who I have become with everything that I have done. There needs to be a respect for them. I have to earn the fact that they care about what I do. I know I have what it takes for that, but I have to do the work. I need to show up and do it, and care about how they react, and then evolve from there. All my life story shows me how sociable I am, how much I enjoy interacting with people that I don’t know, and this is the moment on which I acknowledge that and start building from there. My soul craves for that connection with other human beings.\n\nI remember when I was in india and a guy that took me in his bike, Mohammad, asked me which was my religion. You are, I told him. People are my religion. The amazing fact that each human being is unique is my religion. That is what builds up the fire inside me, and it is time for me to acknowledge that so that I can start helping for real. Because, without knowing it, I have been all this time in the position of a victim, holding the space inside me without wanting to share myself to the world because I’m not good enough. I’m the victim because I think that the world is bad. I’m the victim because I think that I’m not good enough. I’m the victim because it is always about me, and not about the rest. I’m the victim because I think that my way of thinking, my way of creating content should be the one that must be consumed, and I’m the victim because they don’t understand it. They should understand it as I create it, and if they don’t, it is because there is a problem inside them. What a nonsense.\n\nI really want to learn how to get out of the victim mentality, and take action for what matters. And that means following those that have done the work, learning from them, and realizing that there is a way of doing that I have been missing. I keep hiding inside myself so that I don’t have to face the challenge of being cared of. I keep thinking or feeling or whatever that I’m not worthy of love, of attention, and that is what has me in this state of not wanting to share.\n\nBut I am a leader. I am a person that is able to build up strong thoughts and with that build up a new world. I am a person that is consistent, motivated and disciplined. I have what it takes. I put in the effort. I really do it. It is just a matter of commiting to be focused with it. To really do the work that is needed to bring out what is stuck in me, and shine through that. I know that there is something big waiting inside me to be released, and that process is going to happen if I let it out. I just need to be sincere. I just need to be myself. There is nothing more important than that. I know I care, and it is time to care enough to be able to share what I am. To get out of that victim mentality and start building from what is left when the victim is killed. It is time to be responsible for what happens, for my own reality, and how I decide to build it for myself and for those I care about.\n\nThe internet is an amazing place, which opens up the door for me to explore everything that I am. It is time to embody that, and be myself. Without those layers of the mind that wants to be clever. Ego is the one that wants to be clever. And it doesn’t work like that. It never does. All the wisdom is running around in circles, it has always been. Everything points towards becoming a better version of yourself by just knowing yourself better. I have done the work, and now it is time for me to share what I have learned. What comes after all this internal work, so that others can walk the same path and I can be there for them. Not with all these complex systems that no one understands. Nope. It doesn’t work that way. It needs to be in a simple language, that is accessible to most of people, and with a true willingness for them to receive the message.\n\nThat is what it takes.\n\nThat is the true killing of myself. The giving up my willingness to control, and be open to evolve with the input that they are giving me. I have been running until now with the knowledge of the masters that I have been following, it is time to open up that to the world. I know how to do it, I have studied it, I have learned. It is just time to do it. Kill the victim, and take responsibility.\n",

          "raw": "\nToday I want to write about Social Media as a spiritual practice. That is what is the most present in me these days, as I open myself to the possibility of sharing my voice, sharing what I know and where I have got with my internal work. It has been all internal work, and I have not been able to create an outlet with which to share all that has happened with the world. To add value to myself and to other people in the process. They say that this game is about giving and receiving, and because of my incapacity to be an active part of the game we are playing as a society right now I was holding back. I was not realizing the power that publishing content has. And now I’m beginning to realize it, and be open to what comes at the other side. And it feels very good to be able to interact with other people.\n\nTwitter is amazing, because it gives you the opportunity to be there with other people, no matter where they are on their journey. In one sense, it is very similar to meditation, because you can sit down in a zendo with people that have any kind of experience. It doesn’t matter where they are in the journey, what matters is only that they show up. And the same is valid for twitter, because in the timeline it doesn’t matter how much progress you’ve made on the thing, where you are at with it. The only thing that matters is how much value you are adding to the people that will read whatever you write. And this is huge. It truly is similar to meditation, because what you have written before doesn’t matter too much, it only matters what is there. Approaching the thing with beginners mind opens up a lot of doors. It is the way through.\n\nIt is all about adding value to the collective. It is about creating stuff that can make the conversation go further. I mean, this can be applied in any way because there are also people that go there just to throw out shit and be negative, but you get to meet the people that you meet because of how you interact with the platform. It is similar to how life work in many senses, and I feel that it is opening a lot of doors to me. I have a strong urge in my life to have conversations that are meaningful, and to grow as a human being because of the interaction with other people that I feel connected with. Here, I can meet this people, interact with how they think (by what they publish), and learn about life in the process. That is at the core of what social media is, and now I realize how much I was holding back of myself because of not participating in this game.\n\nAnd it also bring into myself a lot of self-awareness, because of what I have to be a witness in myself. For example, today in the morning I had a strong urge to go in and see my notifications, to have that spike in dopamine, and I was able to be a witness of that and don’t fall into that trap. So I’m understanding how valuable it can be also in the aspect of being a witness of my own mind and how it works, and that is very valuable also.\n\nPart of me goes back to the time on which I was not active in any social media and how good it was in many ways, but what was I missing in those moments that I have now? There are so many opportunities in this moment, which are open because of being part of them, and the most important thing for me right now is learning how to establish a healthy balance with the whole thing. It will be important for me to develop this balance, as always, so that I can thrive.\n\nThere is a big aspect of myself related to polarities that is also very clear with my interaction with this thing. I tend to say black or white. I do it every day, or I don’t do it at all. And that is what I’m not realizing, that I don’t need to be too extreme with the way on which I interact with the platform. I don’t need to be there all the time, and I can still do other things. I can still build Dukkha at the same time that I’m participating in the conversation in Twitter, it is not about black or whites. It is about finding balance, always, and using it as a tool, not as an end. I’m not sure if I fit into the whole content creator motto, and if it is the way to go for me, but it doesn’t really matter, because the world will not end tomorrow if I don’t do it properly. Life always gives new opportunities, and in here, every day is a new opportunity to start fresh. That is something that I need to realize completely, and embrace, because my black/white mentality makes me think that everything will be decided in one moment. As if it was like that. It is not like that. Every day is a new opportunity, and the fact that I think that something that I do is THAT important is coming because I’m experiencing reality as if I was at the center of it.\n\nBut I’m not. I’m just another ant in the colony, trying to make its way through the maze as good as I can. We are all making sense of this whole thing, and in that understanding there is progress to be made. There is empathy to be developed, and love for the process to be experienced. We are all in there at the same time, running around the circles of the same stuff, the same wisdom, and the important thing is finding new ways to convey it so that it stucks deeper.\n\nThat is what I’m doing right now, defining my voice, realizing which is the way on which I’m going to share it so that it sticks. I haven’t been able to realize it yet, but I’m moving towards that. I don’t want to be that serious guy that takes everything by heart, but I’m working my way through it. It is always hard for me to define who I am, because it is always evolving. I’m a chameleon, and Twitter gives me the opportunity to explore that every day in a different way. A cool way of experiencing that chameleon-ness that I have come with is creating a new account every month and growing it from 0 to 8k followers. And sharing what I have learned. And do it with completely different stuff. Learning from all the aspects of what is possible in here by just playing the game. Just trying it out.\n\nI go from one idea to the other one, every day, and it is crazy. My mind is crazy. I was meditating before and all that would come to my mind would be different bios, different ways of sharing who I am and what I do. And that is always coming from my point of reference, from my point of view, from who I am. But I need to have into account what I’m there to do for the other person. How will I help her become who she will become. And a big aspect of that will be related to the breathwork practice that I will start going through with people. With that technique, we will go deep into who that person is, to bring down the barriers and with that, bring about what the person truly is.\n\nAnd that is how I come back to Social Media as a spiritual practice, because as those barriers come down there is a need for sharing the truth of who you are. And that truth is powerfully shared through these platforms, by just being yourself. A problem that arises though is the identification that can be built with this sharing. When people start caring too much about how other people react. Maybe the best social media of them all would be one on which you wouldn’t have feedback from what happened with your content. One on which every piece of content would be valued the same, and the net worth of the network would be distributed between each and every one of the participants.\nThis is the world on which time is correlated 1:1 between each person, no matter who the person is. One second that I consume your content is a second of ‘credit’ that I have, and it doesn’t matter whose content it is. It is not attached to a particular person, it is just out there. In that utopical world we could start caring just about the quality of the content, more than the person behind it. On being sincere with it, more than trying to capture that cheap dopamine. But the dopamine thing is the game that we are playing right now, and I have not been able to play it well. I don’t truly understand it.\n\nAnd this is what I mean with ‘meet them where they are at’. Not because I go and play the dopamine game I will be ‘worse’ than the rest. Nope, not at all. It is the game that we are playing right now, and a big part of my spiritual development is related to be able to accept this as a reality and go into that game so that I can better connect with a bunch of people that will start listening to what I say. This is how a shift is made in how we relate as human beings. This is the game that is needed to be played. That is how I’m going to truly evolve, by learning how to play it, on the terms of what is being played, and grow from there. I need to see this as a business, and play it on the business terms.\n\nAm I serious with this thing? Yes. I truly am. I’m doing my thing, and realizing how much value there is on playing it. Should I take myself out of the equation? Is that truly needed? I can play the game in different realms. I can be jp in one side, and I can have an anon account with which to play the game on the other one. I can do it like that, it doesn’t need to be black or white. How much time do I spend being jp on Twitter? Not that much. It is all about being organized, and realizing what can come from there. One can be my personal account, the other one can be the professional one.\n\nOne can be related to my work with the breath, and the other one can be related to my work with meditation. The problem that I have is that I’m too sincere, and it is hard for me to go out of there to start sharing with the world everything that I have accumulated as knowledge. Is it good to be anonymous or should I just share who I am in a clearer way? Define it better, and with that, hold space for my own transformation. I don’t have anything to lose, I’m not in a hurry, things will start happening as they do. It is just a matter of being consistent, and the thing is that I am consistent because I care. I care about sharing my voice, I care about creating systems for stuff to really happen. I’m building this thing with my heart, with everything that I have, because I truly care. How can I categorize myself inside something if I’ve never been able to do it? What is what defines who I am?\n\nI can come back to that Vipassana retreat, on which the first day I was given a piece of paper that asked me the question ‘Who are you?’. That question was running through my mind those 10 days of silence, asking myself who I am all the time. It stills runs. This is who I am, I don’t have a particular answer to the question. I just am. But as soon as I open myself to discover more of the world, and resonate with it, I will better discover who I am by just being sincere. By just being. If I go to twitter and start engaging in conversations with people, just be there with them. Just hold the space for their own transformation. It is not about me. It is never about me. It is about giving and receiving, and now is the time when I open to giving. Each sentence that I’m able to craft is an act of giving, which the other person can receive or not, it depends. It is just part of the game. It is all part of the game, and through this words here I’m learning how to play it. I’m understanding which my role is in this whole game, and the moment on which I realize it better is the moment on which I interact with other people.\n\nWhen I realize that I have something to offer. That they are being sincere. That they are discovering who they are, the same as I am, and that I don’t need to compare myself to where they are at. Every comparison is attached to an expectation of something to be different, and that is not the way to do. I have realized that each time that someone is going through something that is conducing to them being happy, I’m not truly happy for them. I start blaming myself for not being there. I start pushing me down, and being bad to myself because of that. Making this conscious is one of the deepest works that I’m doing now, because I truly want to be happy for the others. If they celebrate that they got 10k followers, be there for them! Don’t blame yourself for not being there yet.\n\nThat is me, trying to be in a place different from the one that I’m at now. It is me comparing myself to who I can become, instead of giving every step that is front of me towards that direction. And the biggest step that I can take is actually being happy for what the other person is sharing, and engaging in that conversation with them. That is the step forward, and as soon as I realize that there is value on it I will start living from that value. I have all my life been living in the future of what can be built, of what can happen, and now is the time on which I embrace everything that has happened and bring everything of what I am into the present moment.\n\nWhich are the decisions that you can make NOW that will impact your life towards that vision that you have?\n\nThe only moment that you have is now. That is the only one. The only moment on which you can act on reality is right now. This is the most important thing to embrace. There is nothing that you can do in the future that can help you become someone different from who you really are. You can just shift your perception of that, but at the bottom of your being, you will be the same, always. You’ll have more tools and ways of conveying who you are, but that eternal exploration is built every day, in every moment, as you decide to engage in life in a or b way. It is a choice, and now is the moment on which I acknowledge all the work that I have done to bring this present moment awareness to my life. And realize that my work is related to helping other people travel that journey also.\n\nA JOURNEY INTO THE PRESENT MOMENT.\n\nThat is a good subtitle for the Transformational Journey. We will travel the depth of the mind in order to go back to where we have always been. Realize the clarity that comes from there. Using the breath, using meditation, and using the tools that will be developer we will be there, Doing The Work. We will always be Doing The Work. It is all about the layers of the onion, that are followed until there is a realization that there is no onion at all, everything was a construct of the mind.\n\nEverything is a construct of the mind, and in the depth of that realization there is a window towards the unknown. I only know that I don’t know. That is what is going on in this ancient wisdom. I only know that every moment is a new exploration into the unknown, of what can be, of what can show itself in this amazing experience called life. I only know that I don’t know, because that is the best way of experiencing life. Always with a beginners mind, trying the best to make as much mistakes as possible so that I can learn from them. That is the game that is being played here, the one of throwing out something and then evaluating what happened with it, feeling how it feels, and with that bodily understanding move forward into a new way of being. Every moment is a window into a new way of being. There doesn’t need to be something more special than what is going on right now.\n\nRight now is perfect. Every piece of information that the world gives you is a mirror into who you are. Everything that happens is a window into who you have been, into who you can be, into who you are. That is the only thing that matters, for you to be who you are.\n\nIn that sense, social media is a spiritual endeavor because it points you towards who you truly are, by throwing out the layers of what you are not. Via negative. Getting there by the negative, because who you are can’t be spoken. It can only be acted, and by sharing what you care about, your thoughts and what you do with the world, you start becoming. You start just being. But the important thing there is to be conscious of how these things work, and with that awareness explore yourself because of how you feel. If there is this strong need of checking the thing, and seeing your notifications, and everything, just be a witness of it, and be disciplined, and learn more about yourself by observing how you feel. Who is the one that feels disappointed if no one comments? Who is the one that is feeling alone? Who is the one that doesn’t trust? This inquiry can go on and on, and ask them to yourself until there is nothing left. Explore everything that you care about, go deep into that exploration, and be free of all of what you think you are. Open up space for what you truly are. Not what you think you are.\n\nThinking is in the realm of mind, and what I’m talking about here is what stays after when the mind is not the means by which reality is experienced. When you open yourself to the possibility of being vulnerable. Of sharing your truth.\n\nWhat is your own and particular truth? There is someone in the world that can benefit from it. What are you waiting to share it? This is the world on which we live in. This is the future. This is where we are going towards. This is what is going to be created. With your effort, with mine, and with the one of every one of us. We are all in this together, and the fact that Twitter is the platform on which we share written text makes it very powerful.\n\nI’m very excited about my participation in there. It has been the biggest spiritual window to the world that I have had, and it feels great. It shows me a lot. I can see the arch of what I have been doing, of what I have shared, of what I care about, and it is quite cool. Learning to grow with the people that resonate. Finding that resonance with people, which has been lost for me before. I have had places on which I have resonated with people, but this is something completely new. This is a new exploration, a new experience, and I love it. I’m curious, excited and willing to learn.\n\nA journey into the present moment with a featured artist. Holy shit, that is powerful. Having a particular person help us create what we want to create, and make our way through it with their help. That is the thing with Dukkha. It doesn’t matter which kind of creative endeavor we are up to. It truly doesn’t matter, because who we are can be expressed through any of them. It only matters that we tap into that capacity of being genuine and build from there. Trusting on what will come. There will be people that will want to dive into this, and my mission is just to trust in what will happen with them. Open up the opportunity for this thing to happen.\n\nThere will be the ones that listen. And I’m the first one that listen to what comes out of my mouth. I’m there one that will be there to experience the awe, to experience what is brought to me every time that I read the words that are typed by this fingers.\n\nI only know that I don’t know, and that is because I don’t have any clue about what will be brough up by me in the next moment. And by sharing that voice to the world, I open up to be seen. By myself. By realizing what was brought into my experience. And being a witness of it. Not feel identified by it, but just be a witness of how the conditioned mind feels identified with the consequences of what is brought up by the actions that are undertaken.\n\nWho is the one that feels anxious?\nWho is the one that feels imposter syndrome?\nWho is the one that doesn’t feel worthy of attention?\n\nAsk yourself that question, deeply, each time that you click the publish button, until there is no one left. Until what is left is only the truth of who you are. Pure creativity, pure energy moving towards a deeper connection with what you have always been.\n\nEvery interaction with another human being is a window into a deeper understanding of who you are. Social media is the biggest window that we have ever had to this. Learn how to use it in your benefit, and no one will stop you. Be open to be transformed. Be open to become. All what you have ever been, but that you have not been able to realize yet. Throw away the mask, and check what is left there afterwards.\n\nWho are you when there is no you anymore?\n",

They say that this game is about giving and receiving, and because of my incapacity to be an active part of the game we are playing as a society right now I was holding back.

And the same is valid for twitter, because in the timeline it doesn\\u2019t matter how much progress you\\u2019ve made on the thing, where you are at with it. The only thing that matters is how much value you are adding to the people that will read whatever you write. And this is huge.

It is similar to how life work in many senses, and I feel that it is opening a lot of doors to me. I have a strong urge in my life to have conversations that are meaningful, and to grow as a human being because of the interaction with other people that I feel connected with. Here, I can meet this people, interact with how they think (by what they publish), and learn about life in the process.

It is always hard for me to define who I am, because it is always evolving. I\\u2019m a chameleon, and Twitter gives me the opportunity to explore that every day in a different way. A cool way of experiencing that chameleon-ness that I have come with is creating a new account every month and growing it from 0 to 8k followers. And sharing what I have learned.

When people start caring too much about how other people react. Maybe the best social media of them all would be one on which you wouldn\\u2019t have feedback from what happened with your content. One on which every piece of content would be valued the same, and the net worth of the network would be distributed between each and every one of the participants.\nThis is the world on which time is correlated 1:1 between each person, no matter who the person is.

It is not attached to a particular person, it is just out there. In that utopical world we could start caring just about the quality of the content, more than the person behind it.

It is the game that we are playing right now, and a big part of my spiritual development is related to be able to accept this as a reality and go into that game so that I can better connect with a bunch of people that will start listening to what I say. This is how a shift is made in how we relate as human beings. This is the game that is needed to be played.

I have realized that each time that someone is going through something that is conducing to them being happy, I\\u2019m not truly happy for them. I start blaming myself for not being there.

The best example for that is what just happened in me, after having an amazing meditation this morning. I decided that I would use everything that was brought up because of the meditation in service of connecting with people, so I decided to go in Twitter with that intention. To answer back to people, and connect in a meaningful way. But what ended up happening was not that, I ended up disappointed with the whole experience, and with feelings of not being enough, of not deserving attention, of being an imposter.\n\nEverything that that brought to me was negative thoughts and feelings, and that is not what I should bring into me after a moment so important like that meditation. I need to be intentional with what I do after it, and today I was not able to do it in a way that makes sense. That is a huge learning for me. Meditation brings up the neurochemicals that produce feelings of being grounded, of being in this moment, and social media bring up the opposite. This ends up creating a chemical mess inside me, and it is not helpful for my creative process. That’s something that I need to take care of, because no one is going to do it for me. Huge learning for today.\n\nBut it is also interesting to be a witness of what was brought up, and how I feel about it. It is part of my experience, and part of who I am, so I need to watch it closely and be there for these feelings of anxiety and not being enough-ness. They are constantly brought up to me because there is a need for being useful that has not been met yet. I’m on my own void, alone, and there is a big need of connecting with people in a meaningful way. I still haven’t been able to resolve it, and I’m working on that. I’m realizing what my role is in the whole thing. I want to be there holding space for people, but I really don’t know how to do it.\n\nJust reach out, probably. That is the thing. Reaching out and holding space for others. How can they know that I want to hold space for them if I don’t let them know? For example after the morning meditations everyone goes away and the day continues as if anything would have happened. What if I use that space as the means for a deeper exploration into what is present in the life of the other people? What if instead of putting a timer for going into Twitter for half an hour I use that time to connect with people that are in the same frequency that I am? And who can be better people than the ones that are inside that meditation room? Today we were like 15, and each one of them were there for the whole hour. Those are the hardcore meditators that I want to interact with.\n\nI need to be more intelligent on how I spend my precious life force, and to what activities I give my energy to. I do care, I truly care, and if I go into social media and spend it there trying to care and try to catch attention just because I care too much to not do it, I will be disappointed every day because probably that is not the place for that. It is a place for entertainment, for scrolling in the timeline and being entertained by that. It is not the place for deepening the connection with other humans. I can build those connections in other places. That is my job, to better get a grasp of how the internet works and realize which is the value that I’m bringing.\n\nI felt empty after that half an hour, and that was perfect. It is what it is. It is the information that I need to bring in so that I can better understand how I am part of that network. Actually, maybe it was a good thing to be in there for that time. Yes. Now that I better think about it, it was a good thing to experience what I experienced. Life is not about bringing only ‘good’ stuff, only ‘good’ feelings. It is about really caring for what is done. And they always speak about having 10k followers so that only 1% really care about what you do, and 1% of 10k is 100. What if I end up with a following of 100, but all of them truly care about what I do? What if that is the game that I will play? Because the content that I’m publishing is valuable. The interactions that I am building there are valuable. I just need to better understand how to play the game.\n\nThat is the thing. Learning how to play the game. Creating a system for myself. A system that can enable me to play the game in a way on which I don’t feel identified by it. There is nothing in me that brings up more anxiety than being public, and that is the game that I have to play. Being public. Bring all of those feelings into me, and don’t feel identified by them. Don’t feel that they are what I am, but just give my best, every day, so that I can just show up with what I am. Don’t pretend to be someone different. 2\n\nI discover who I am by interacting with people like you. That is something that is always present in me. Kind of my motto for being in Social Media. Taking it seriously, and discovering more and more about myself in the process. That is the spiritual journey that is taking place. Me, interacting with other people, and sharing my voice with them. Sharing what I have learned through the words that I’m able to come up with. That is the game. And I won’t make progress in that game if I’m still hidden below my rock. Nope, that is not how it works. What works is to share myself, to open up to what is, and realize who I am in the process of being exposed.\n\nThere is people that are much more intelligent than me, and it is important to change my perspective of my interaction with them from:\n\n- The victim mentality of ‘I will never get there’ to ‘What can I learn from them?’\n- The envy mentality because of what they have achieved (and I have not) to the humble mentality of recognizing their journey and where they are at.\n\nThese are aspects of what can be brought up if I start being part of social media in a way that is productive for myself. Truly in a spiritual way, trying to connect with the message of the person that is at the other side. Not with how the message impacts me and how it makes me feel, but with how the message is built from that person’s perspective, and how I can help that person get to know herself a little bit more by diving into the reasons why they published that.\n\nThere is an underlying aspect of why every person publishes everything that they publish on SM, and it is my mission to be able to tap into that. Not how it makes me feel, but how I can help them feel who they are deeper because of what I can add to the conversation.\n\nThere is a fundamental shift in the perspective that I have had my whole life related to the use of social media and what it brings to our existence as human beings, and now is the time on which I’m better able to realize the power of it. What it truly brings.\n\nSocial media as a spiritual practice. That is the game that I’m playing, because in the act of sharing oneself there is more information that what we have been able to access ever before. If we are able to tap into this information and realize how we feel, there will be a major transformation deep within. We evolve as human beings as we are able to tap deeper into who we truly are, and in that sense, each interaction that you can have (with intention and consciousness) in social media can be the means by which you evolve spiritually. It is as if every moment can be a prompt into the question: ‘Tell me who you are’.\n\nWho is the one that wants to laugh when she sees a TikTok video?\nWho is the one that feels jealous when she sees a model on Instagram?\nWho is the one that gets anxiety when there is a thread on Twitter with information that you have not been able to put into practice in your own life?\nWho is the one that just wants to be entertained with Youtube videos?\n\n--\n\nWhat brings anxiety in the interaction of ourselves with all these platforms is the gap between where we are at now and where we want to be. There is a fundamental need inside us to belong, and if we are able to train all these platforms into our benefit, the amount of value that we can get out of that is huge. There is no limit to it. You can polish it, build with it, and from there, evolve as a human being.\n\nWe are social creatures, and that’s why all these platforms are so powerful. That’s why they have the impact that they have. And they are tools, powerful tools, and it is very important for us to realize the power that is behind them because of that. What if we stopped the doomscrooling and came in with intention? What is the intention that I have by going into Instagram today?\n\nIt is very interesting to have witnessed the power of that ad that coinbase created for the superbowl. It was only a blank screen, with a QR code. The important thing is not the ad itself, the important thing is how to transform that ad into an experience that can take the person into a journey. That is the game that we are playing here. Going into that journey with all the ones that want to come in.\n\nAnd I doubt that there won’t be people that are willing to feel better from their anxiety. And I doubt that there won’t be people that want to get truly the most out of life. And that is why we need to start living with intention, to get the most out of everything with intention.\n\nWhat if you had 30 minutes of Instagram each day, and you approached them with intention? Better than this. You have unlimited time on Instagram, but you’ve got to approach only 30 minutes of it with pure intention. With pure willingness to go deeper into the knowing of what you truly want, of what you truly care about. Of truly connecting with other people, without being anxious about what it brings.\n\nThat’s it. Social media as a spiritual practice. That is the game that I’m learning how to play here, and that is why I have created this whole thing now. There is no need to have new systems in place because they are all already here. Why should I make them all more complex. There is no need for it. What I have to do is frame part of what I do with intention, with pure intention to explore what is present inside me as I do it, so that I can start learning more about myself in the process.\n\nI go into Twitter and I feel like a failure? Take time afterwards to truly feel how it feels to be a failure. Where is it in the body? What does it remind you? We have the most powerful tool of them all right here, and it is time for you to start living by it. No one will do it for me. No one will do it for you. Social media as a spiritual practice is the thing. And I will learn more about myself by being exposed to it and feeling what comes than what I will learn about myself in 1000 meditation retreats. This is what the exponential era is about. Seeing the sacred in everything, our sacred connection to ourselves. And what is more powerful than realizing that there is a perception of gap between where you are at now and where you want to be? Where does that perception come from? Who is the one that feels it? Is that really you?\n\nThat is the game that I’m learning how to play. It is all a game, and the moment on which I truly realize that and stop becoming identified by the feelings and sensations and emotions that come up when I read something that makes me feel bad, I will start becoming free.\n\nThis is the most important training that anyone can go through in this moment. We all use social media, and no one knows how to use it properly. It is time for us to learn how to do it. It is time for me to learn how to use it, so that I can share what I have learned with people and make our world a better place by helping people connect with who they truly are. Each platform is a different adventure, and in each of them there is a case to be made for you to learn more about yourself.\n\nIt is just about bringing intention into the game, and realizing that everything that arises in your experience because of your interaction with these platforms (with other people through these platforms), is the most valuable information about yourself that you can get. We live in an incredible time, and it is time to realize it and embody everything that it brings to us.\n\nSocial media as a spiritual practice. That is my new sadhana. That is the big shift, the big transformation that my soul was craving for. Each person is a creative force, and we all need to become creators in our own way. 99% of people are consumers because they don’t trust enough in what they have to share to just share it, they think that they need to research more, or just be more knowledgeable. What if we opened the door of creativity as a collective? What if all of us started sharing our voice, no matter how ‘bad’ it would be?\n\nHere we come back into those polarities, because saying that something is bad or good is always in relationship with an expectation for it to be different from what it is. There is nothing as ‘good’ or ‘bad’. There just is. Just hit the publish button, and witness the transformation that comes to you because of that. Be a witness of all the sensations that are brought up by opening yourself to share your voice to the world, to the open void. Realize the power that lies in this opening. Realize that you are a creative force, and that life is waiting for you to embody it in any way.\n\nThat is the sadhana that Dukkha has been talking about. It is about being consistent in the sharing of what you have learned, of where you are at, without caring too much about it being ‘good’ or ‘bad’. It is about the end of shoulds, because nothing ‘should’ be different from what it actually is. This is just a construct of the mind, which loves polarities, which loves to be in a place different from where it is at right now.\n\nBut what if we all, as a collective, embraced the fact that we are all where we are at, and it is perfect as it is? What if we were able to truly embrace this and live from that understanding? I’m talking about truly embodying it. In every aspect of yourself.\n\nAnd this what I’m talking about here is just about that. It is about opening the window for training yourself in a new way of using social media. In an intentional way. In the way that your soul truly wants to. We have all wanted to send that DM, or comment in that picture, and we have not been able to do it because of what they ‘could’ think. What if we truly gived a fuck about this and just opened ourselves to what comes at the other side?\n\nWhat could be more powerful than realizing what we truly care about, and being a witness of how we can get more of it, and interact with the people that create that? And also be a creator ourselves. That is the game that we are learning how to play here. The consistency game. The one of trusting who you are without barriers, without problems, without anything in between.\n\nWe are deep into depression because we truly don’t understand who we are, and my deep craving is to help people get out of there. But how can they get out of there if there is not the external means for doing it? And social media is one of the things that people spend their energy the most in, so the impact that this way of doing things will have is just huge. I haven’t seen anything like this. I haven’t being able to witness what comes out of people consistently tapping into what they care about (because they follow it, and spend their energy in it), and truly feel how it feels to follow that person. Does it really resonate with who you are? Does it really tap into the depth of you? Start cleaning everything that you have been, everything that is shown to you, so that you can better understand who you are. What you care about. That is the biggest gift that you can give yourself. Training the algo in your benefit. In YOUR benefit. For your true self to shine through all the time that you spend consuming content from other people. And it is not consuming, it is interacting.\n\nWhen you watch the video of a creator, you are just having a conversation with her. She just doesn’t know it. But if you open up the possibility for that communication to truly start, by opening yourself to share with her what the content truly brought up to you, how it made you feel, there will be a transformation inside you that will be very powerful.\n\nSomething will be changed. Something will be shifted. That is the game that we are playing here. That is what is going to change humanity and the relationship that we have with ourselves. The intention for it to change. That is why there won’t be a magical dwarf that will come up with his wand and change everything overnight. Nope. We’ve got to Do The Work. Together. We’ve got to realize how the world on which we live works, and live from there.\n\nScript:\n\nWelcome to a new day of Social Sadhana. I want to invite you to close your eyes for a while, and connect to that aspect that is deep within you and that just wants to play. It just wants to be connected to people with which it resonates, and this moment is an invitation for that. It is an invitation for you to connect with what you care about, what you trust, what you feel, and be open to be the means by which more of that comes into the world.\n\nAnd now I want to invite you to open up your eyes, and go into the social media platform of your choice. May it be TikTok, or Youtube, or Twitter, or Instagram. It doesn’t truly matter, the important part of it is that you like it. Go in there, and start consuming content with intention. As you see a video, or an image, or a tweet, take a bit of time to truly feel how it feels inside you. Do you resonate with what it brings or those sensations are just an automatic response to what you are craving for in your own life? Is it helping you to make progress towards where you want to be?\n\nTake a moment to connect with what is present in your whole system, and because of that, decide how you are going to progress from here. Will you unfollow that person because you don’t like what you see? Will you comment something so that that person knows that there is someone watching, someone that truly resonates with what is being witness? How does it help you on your own path? How are you different after having seen this?\n\nTake a moment to be mindful of everything that is brought up in your experience. Enjoy it, enjoy the casquade of chemicals that is present in your body right now, and move on. If you forget to do this process, it doesn’t matter. We are just training ourselves here to become more mindful, and it won’t happen overnight. We are training ourselves, and it will take time. But each moment that you spend doing this, is the most valuable gift that you can give you in your life. The amount of time that is spent mindlessly scrolling through social media is huge, and by taking this mindful time to do it differently you are truly changing the history of humanity, just by changing your own history.\n\nI’m sure that over time there will be a big shift in yourself, and that shift will be brought because of the different way on which you will approach your interaction with this platform that you chose. Maybe next time you will take a little time to answer back. To comment. To reach out. Maybe you’ll unfollow that person that doesn’t truly add value to your experience. Maybe nothing will change at all, but always remind you that there is something that is changing, because you are acting differently than before.\n\nThe algorithms of all these platforms is just amazing, it is a miracle, and if you start having a good relationship with it your whole life will change. Your whole perspective of what it means to be alive in this moment will be transformed, and you will start to become free.\n\nFree from the unconscious patters of action that have you in this mindless consumption of content, just for the sake of adding noise to your experience as a human being.\n\nFree to open up to truly feel how it feels to be anxious, alone, desperate, lost.\n\nFree to truly experience how it feels to not know where to go. You are not alone.\n\nFree to express how you felt. The creators are waiting for it.\n\nFree to just be yourself. We are all special, we are all unique.\n\nFree to share your gift with the world. That specific gift that only you have inside, and that is waiting to be shared with every human being that is alive.\n\nFree to enjoy. Free to be. Just be. We all came here to do that.\n\nBut you’ve got to do the work first.\n\n--\n\nBringing people out of social media is not about creating new means for them to entertain themselves outside it. The only way in is through. The only means for evolving from where we are at now is by using these tools to deepen our relationship with ourselves. That is the way. They are too addictive to be forgotten, to addictive for any alternative to be built. It needs to be a process that is done mindfully, by each person that is part of them, by just showing up. Every day. To do what they have always done, but with a slightest touch of mindfulness in every scroll. In every interaction. Maybe have a diary next to you, a notebook. How do you feel watching the post of X?\n\nWhat does it bring into your life?\n\nHow do you feel when you share how you feel? What does it bring to your experience?\n\nSocial media as a spiritual practice is something new, it is a new way of existing, which is built over the sense that each of us has something unique to share. And each of us is a unique spark of light. Let’s make it shine, through each and every one of us.\n",

          "raw": "\nThe level of control that my being needs to excerpt to feel safe is incredible to me. I really don’t know how it is possible that it is so hard to let go, to just be free from this eternal wanting for things to be different. That is the mind, always looking for separation, with its eternal need for noise. But it is a journey, and I tend to fall into the trap of wanting the journey to end soon so that I can enjoy what is at the other side, not realizing that the whole journey is the nice part, the interesting one, the one that is worth navigating. It is all in what arises in this journey, and how I am able to develop a conscious experience with all of it. As I wrote that down, I remembered that I am breathing, and started making it conscious again. What a nice feeling, that of remembering. Of coming back to the practice. It is forgotten sometimes, but it is like a pendulum, which always tends to go to the center. Or, as Adyashanti would say, my consciousness is like a rocket ship that is lifting off from the ground, but the gravity that is present is so strong that each time it lifts off, it comes back. In this case, the lifting off would be the remembering, and the coming back, the forgetting. I have always been in the domain of action of this gravity, my whole life, but there is a knowing that there is something out there, and an absolute willingness to discover what it is through my own experience.\n\nThat is the thing. Experience. It is all within. Each experience that you have gone through in your existence is somewhere there, within, waiting for you to translate it into a way of being. Into an aspect of being. Every time that I go through something there is a remembering of the important aspect of it: How will this impact the way on which I will experience the rest of my present moments in the future? How is this going to help me to live more in the present? That is all what is needed, ultimately. To live experiences that help you more and more to live in the present, because that is everything that you have, and everything that you will ever have. Each time I go through a session of whatever I decide to do, there is this notion present. How is this going to transform my capacity to act from a place of truth? And I guess that is the game that we are playing here. Living different experiences that enable us to make those realizations, in our own path.\n\nThe most important thing is that every experience is deeply personal, and that you can’t extrapolate the experience of others into your own. Each of us goes through particular things and has particular dispositions inside, and the important aspect of it is to be able to recognize that the experience of others is helpful for yourself as you are able to tap into the fundamental aspect of what being a human being is, from the experience of that person, into yours. And more importantly, it is the other way around.\n\nThinking that the fact that other people will benefit from what has happened in your experience is a trick from the ego, because it doesn’t take into account the experience of the other person and how what you are sharing will impact them. That is something that I’m very challenged about, and that right now I’m better understanding as I write about it. The fact that I’m not able to reach out to my audience, or find it, or communicate clearly with the people that will care about what I have to say, and will be helped by what I create, is because I think that my experience can be directly translated into theirs, and that they can benefit directly from reading my own experience, on my own words. This is coming from a place of ego, of wanting them to experience the same as I did.\n\nBut it doesn’t work like that. The analogy that I made the other day was that of a bridge. If you yell from the side of the bridge where you are at so that the other person can cross, probably no one will listen, because they are too busy with what they are doing at that side. The thing there is to take all your humbleness, get your shit together, and cross the bridge so that you can experience what is going on at the other side from another perspective. And with that, realize which is the correct way to bring them to where you are at. That is something that is always challenging to me, and I’m learning how to do it as I discover which is the way on which I share myself with the world. Such an important thing to realize that, and as always, it is all about starting. And iterating from what has happened.\n\nThat is the game, and that is the trap that I tend to fall into a lot. I know everything that is possible from a theoretical standpoint because of what I experienced in Canada, and I want all the world to live like that, but I miss the way on which to reach that world, so that there can be a transformation that can be fostered by what I do. And that transformation is just within myself, because I want to be heard. I want people to read what I write. I write good stuff, in a good way. It is valuable. And right now, no one reads it, because it gets lost in the translation. It is time for me to realize which is the way on which I’m going to communicate with the world, so that my message can get out there. That is the game. And that is what I have been learning how to do all this time. Learning how to play it. And more than learning how to play it, just playing it. I have done the work also. I have showed up.\n\nAnd just as myself. That is the thing. I’m a unique human being that brings its own sauce to the game, and I’m here because I want to just be myself. I’m completely authentic, I have nothing to hide, and until now I have been hiding because this authenticity thinking that the world owes me something because of it. There is something different that should be happening because I have done all the work that I have done, and I am where I am at in my path. What a nonsense. It doesn’t work like that. If I have been able to gather the wisdom that I have gathered, it is because of who I am, and now it is time to translate all of that into a language that can be comprehended by the people that have not walked this path. This is a major challenge, because my ego loves to make things complicated.\n\nAnd I think this is an answer to the necessity that I have for being different than my parents. I grew up in a house where we never talked about things that can be ‘important’ for me in an intellectual level. There is a deep need in me to have this being different, for having had more interesting conversations, of science, of the meaning of life, of what it means to be a human being, all of those things. But nope, we talked about soccer and what was going on in the TV. So I built for myself a shelter in the intellectual level, always wanting to go deeper in that realm so that I could satisfy this enormous need that I have for ‘something more’. There is always that need present. And it doesn’t make me good, because it doesn’t let me realize all the value that was present in my house just because of the fact that my family was always there. My parents were together, sitting down at the table, showing up for each other. No matter how hard it was because me and my brother were always fighting with each other, behaving bad in school, and everything. No matter what, they always showed up. I could spend my whole life blaming them for not being interesting… But when is the moment on which I acknowledge that they did the best they could with the tools that they had at hand?\n\nPerharps this is that moment, because there is a deep need inside myself to just realize that. To become free from the ‘wanting them to be different’, and open to all of who they are. All of what my life has been, because it makes me who I am today. It is brutal to be able to realize that these layers of intellect where built as an answer to something that was present in my life t that moment, and that there is a time to let go of that layers. And probably this is that time, in a way, because being over rational, wont let me connect with people. I stand away, because I rationalize everything and it goes through my mind before than it goes through my heart. And this brings me away from people And I want to be connected with them, they are my gods. Each person, each being, is my own god. It is her and his own god. And this is the time on which I realize that, and I move towards embodying it in every aspect of my being. Because it is not something instant as if I write it down here and ‘Poof!’, it is over. It doesn’t work like that. This is a window into exploring more of what is present. And it is my duty to open that window and walk through it, and that is something that is done every day, as I encounter those situations on which I feel in a certain way. As I encounter every situation really, because they are all means for going deeper into the knowing of who I am. What I bring into the world.\n\nThere is an eternal need for me to live life at its fullest, to be the most evolved human being than I can, and the truth is that all of that is a construct of my ego. I am already complete, and time is something that doesn’t constitute the fundamental aspect of reality. There is something deeper than time, more fundamental, and everything that I do, in every moment, can be an exploration into that.\n\n--\n\nI want to explore a little bit the role of the mentor here. Of the teacher. On this moment, on which all the information is available out there, and it is up to us to find our own internal compass that enables us to navigate the waters of this modern world. I’m thinking particularly about my woodworking mentor. I can go in there, and ask him how to do something, and he will give me the answer and save me a lot of time. But I can also go into youtube and watch a video and learn from someone that is sharing his knowledge with the world in a more open way. And I wonder: Which is the reason that you go to one or another?\n\nOne that is obvious is because of the information. There was something that was needed to be done, and there was not a particular knowing of how to do it, so you go to the teacher for him to teach you. But know that information is easier and easier to get, so this one being diluted more and more.\n\nThe next one that comes to mind is about the connection. There is a complicity in the relationship that comes from having a person which you trust, and which shows you the way. It is a very big relief for the ego, because you can count on that person to be able to show you where to move to. You don’t need to realize the stuff on your own, and you don’t have to spend the energy of ‘being lost’ and going to somewhere that is not helping you. And it also feels good, because in some way you are avoiding to do the hard work of coming up with the stuff on your own. It relieves the pain of being alone.\n\nAnd then comes the next one, which is huge right now in this moment of development of the internet: The community. A teacher is a person that gathers around him people that are interested in that same topic. And that is powerful, because it taps into a fundamental aspect of what being a human being is: Being part of a tribe. We are tribal beings, and we just want to belong. And following a teacher of some particular subject that is interesting for us brings us to that tribe. It helps us to belong.\n\nAnother aspect is the curation of content. The pointers that they can give you that can help you go in one direction or another. There are the people that truly care about their craft and study it 24/7 so that they can get a deeper understanding of it, and share their knowledge because it is what comes from the bottom of their heart, and there are the people that just do it, over and over, and with that they become really good at it, but always inside their own mind. There is a lot of power in sharing what is known, and this is something that the internet also opens up as an opportunity for our development. It is easier than ever to be a teacher. Everything you need is a camera and a computer, and you can share what you know with all the world.\n\nHow am I sharing what I know? Which is the aspect of my being that wants more to be shared with the world? What is the most valuable aspect of myself, that the world could benefit enormously if it was shared by me?\n\nWhat comes to mind is my capacity of exploring the unknown, which has always been underrated for me. I don’t have any problem to jump in into everything that is in front of me, and that is something that is absolutely valuable. And underrated. It is time for me to start sharing more of this, of me being a chameleon. I truly am a chameleon, and that is the interesting part of this whole thing. Of who I am. I don’t have any problem to go from A to B, that is not where the resistance comes from. My soul feels excited to get to know a little bit more about life by exploring a different avenue. And this goes to the contrary of what they always say, about depth in one skill being more important than shallowness in a lot of them. But it is not like that, I’m not seeing the big picture and giving me credit that I am developing a skill, and the one that is the most important for me in the world: Presence. I’m learning how to live life in the present moment, and right now I’m thinking about the book the art of learning, and how it spoke about being present as the most important skill of them all so that you can truly learn anything. Putting the whole skin into the game. And this connects very deeply with the whole Deep Work and Deep Rest thing, and it is part of what I need to better understand how to frame so that I can build something valuable for the world.\n\nI’m beginning to understand which is the frame of reference that I will use to create, to help people. Yesterday I wrote about social media as a spiritual practice, and today I’m talking about learning to learn as the way on which I want to share myself with the world. I want to teach you how to learn, because the school system has failed us. That is where my energy is going right now, to helping people learn how to learn.\n\nWhich is the problem that I’m solving? Which is the problem that I’m solving in myself? My incapacity to focus. I write that and it sounds funny even to read it, because I am focused right now in what I’m writing. I’m putting all my life force into it. Where is your life force going towards right now? The problem is not that I’m not able to focus, the problem is that. I have too many interests. Everything is interesting for me, everything in the world. I can’t decide where to move to, because it is all appealing. And the fact that life gave me the material opportunity to explore has been huge for me as the means by which I discover this, but it is also a huge helper of bringing me into this maze, because with all the options that I have I’m lost. There is a feeling inside that there is something ‘more important’ than another thing, and that’s why I start doing something and then I do another thing and I keep like this over and over iterating, as if I was the only person in the world that has this problem. It is me thinking that I’m special, but I’m not. It is something that happens to all of us, in one way or another, and it is important for me to acknowledge it so that I can realize that I’m not the special one and that all of what I’m doing here is keep hiding from the truth of what I am: Who I am in each interaction with the world. Who I am every day on which I decide to show up and bring my truth.\n\nWhat is my truth today? What was it yesterday? What hasn’t changed in the meantime? That is the interesting part of it all. To really dive deep into what hasn’t changed, and realize that that is who I am.\n\nAll this writing that comes from me, and never connected to how you may feel. I wonder, if there is someone that will read this in any moment of history. How do you feel by reading the maze that I have inside my head? Does it help you feel connected? Does it help you in any way? Do you relate to it? Or am I just being selfish and running through my own mind here?\n\nI told it before, I’m doing my best here to learn how to do this thing. It is quite a challenge. I’m sure that one day we will look back at where we are at now and be amazed by it. How identified we were with the construct that is within our own mind. How that identification was not letting us enjoy life and live to our fullest potential.

That is the mind, always looking for separation, with its eternal need for noise. But it is a journey, and I tend to fall into the trap of wanting the journey to end soon so that I can enjoy what is at the other side, not realizing that the whole journey is the nice part, the interesting one, the one that is worth navigating. It is all in what arises in this journey, and how I am able to develop a conscious experience with all of it. As I wrote that down, I remembered that I am breathing, and started making it conscious again. What a nice feeling, that of remembering. Of coming back to the practice. It is forgotten sometimes, but it is like a pendulum, which always tends to go to the center. Or, as Adyashanti would say, my consciousness is like a rocket ship that is lifting off from the ground, but the gravity that is present is so strong that each time it lifts off, it comes back. In this case, the lifting off would be the remembering, and the coming back, the forgetting.

How is this going to help me to live more in the present? That is all what is needed, ultimately. To live experiences that help you more and more to live in the present, because that is everything that you have, and everything that you will ever have. Each time I go through a session of whatever I decide to do, there is this notion present. How is this going to transform my capacity to act from a place of truth?

The fact that I\\u2019m not able to reach out to my audience, or find it, or communicate clearly with the people that will care about what I have to say, and will be helped by what I create, is because I think that my experience can be directly translated into theirs, and that they can benefit directly from reading my own experience, on my own words.

The thing there is to take all your humbleness, get your shit together, and cross the bridge so that you can experience what is going on at the other side from another perspective.

That is something that is always challenging to me, and I\\u2019m learning how to do it as I discover which is the way on which I share myself with the world.

No matter how hard it was because me and my brother were always fighting with each other, behaving bad in school, and everything. No matter what, they always showed up.

It is brutal to be able to realize that these layers of intellect where built as an answer to something that was present in my life t that moment, and that there is a time to let go of that layers. And probably this is that time, in a way, because being over rational, wont let me connect with people. I stand away, because I rationalize everything and it goes through my mind before than it goes through my heart. And this brings me away from people And I want to be connected with them, they are my gods. Each person, each being, is my own god. It is her and his own god. And this is the time on which I realize that, and I move towards embodying it in every aspect of my being. Because it is not something instant as if I write it down here and \\u2018Poof!\\u2019, it is over. It doesn\\u2019t work like that. This is a window into exploring more of what is present.

I don\\u2019t have any problem to go from A to B, that is not where the resistance comes from. My soul feels excited to get to know a little bit more about life by exploring a different avenue. And this goes to the contrary of what they always say, about depth in one skill being more important than shallowness in a lot of them. But it is not like that, I\\u2019m not seeing the big picture and giving me credit that I am developing a skill, and the one that is the most important for me in the world: Presence. I\\u2019m learning how to live life in the present moment, and right now I\\u2019m thinking about the book the art of learning, and how it spoke about being present as the most important skill of them all so that you can truly learn anything.

It is the end of suffering, through the end of comparisons. The end of expectations.\n\nEnlightenment is the absolute absence of expectations.\n\nThe end of shoulds, is the end of expectations. How would your life look life if there was not an expectation for it to be different present? How would your connection with yourself be transformed if this was the case? It is time to explore that, and what I’m creating is an exploration into that understanding. That is built working with others, doing the work. Each one of us has to do the work, of looking inside, and realizing what is in there. To be the witness of the emotions that you will bring in the other people. How do you want to make them feel. That is the whole game, to feel yourself through what you make other people feel.\n\nPut yourself in the shoes of the consumer of your content, of your creations, by feeling how you feel consuming the one of people that you admire. What does it bring into yourself? How does it resonate with you? What is present in that resonance? Where does it come from? These are all aspects of this exploration, because on the minute that we start creating from the heart, for people that will resonate with what we are creating, consciousness starts to lift off into the comprehension of itself. There is a deep transformation that is created within, as this journey of exploration is built into the fabric of what we can do. And when we create from this place, there is not an expectation for it to be different. Better. There is only the creative act, and what is brought into the individual because of this constant exploration into what already is. This is the journey that I am at, and this is where I’m travelling towards.\n\nDukkha is all about bringing this into more and more people, using the connection to the self as a means of putting the toe inside the ocean of spirit, so that from there creations can arise. From a place of pure connection with yourself. With your source. A key aspect of this whole thing is to have a creative output, and we are going to work on that throughout the time that we spend together. This cohort is going to be about Doing The Work, and my mission is to bring that about for the people that are going to be part of it. I always call myself as a light that shines towards the people that want to be seen, and this project is the closest that I have gotten towards that.\n\nAnd breathwork helps me move in that direction, because it gives me a tool to help people go deep within themselves.\n\nThe only way in is through, and social media as a spiritual practice is the way on which depression is going to end in the world. We are where we are because of all the comparisons with other people, and the only one with which we have to compare ourselves is with ourselves. How are you doing today? How are you doing compared to yesterday? How does this resonate with the people that you are talking to? What does it bring to their experience? How can you refine your message so that it can speak more directly to who they are? Who do you want to talk to? Who are you? Who do you want to be? This are all questions that require a better understanding of what has happened in life until this point, and in the moment that you open yourself to answer them there is an opening. There is a deepening related to your mission. And the breathwork practice is the means to make this opening clearer. To make it happen. Clarity needs to exist in order for you to realize which is the message that you want to convey to your audience, and I’m here to hold space for that to happen. Dukkha will be a consequence of these first explorations.\n\nIt is time to trust myself. It is time to realize that all the work that I have done puts me in a position from which I can help others get to know themselves better. So that they can grow from there. No one says that it will be easy, I just say that it will be. It will happen. And what comes after that is something that cannot be known, because it is by definition the unknown. Nothing can truly be known. I spend so much time building my website to generate trust in what I am, without realizing that I already have it. I already have all this people that know me better than I do, and that trust me better than I do. It is time for me to grow towards that, and to educate people in that journey of self discovery also.\n\nAs I open myself to help, I open the window to help myself also. As I deepen the understanding of what social media brings into the world, I deepen my understanding of what I can bring into that world, and how I can help humanity thrive because of that. Isn’t it important that each person has the opportunity to share who she is through the creative act?\n\nThe thing is that we all think that we need to ask for permission. That we should be someone before we can commit to do something. That is the most basic lie that society has told us, and it is what has us inside this hole. We all feel like an imposter because there is within us conditioning related to having to achieve something before we can become. And what we have been missing is that we already are what we can become. We are in it. We have always been there. The only thing that we have to do is to unlearn it, so that we can move forward from that understanding into what we can create from that place of knowing. From that connection. Creativity is the future, and those that are able to connect to it from a place of clarity, of truth, are the ones that will be able to thrive. And Dukkha will be a consequence of this.\n\nIt is not about building it before all the other things are in place, it is about building it as the other things are being put in its place. Only today I invited 4 people to be part of this journey. Just in one day. How amazing that can be. For me to realize the power that lies within me, that I can just open that door for once and for all. The amount of learning that will come from travelling this journey with the people that I will help is the means by which I will be able to evolve. That is the aspect of myself that was waiting to be unleashed, the one that wants to help other people thrive. The one that wants other people to truly connect with themselves. That is the door that is being opened. And through this writing is how I clarify what is inside of me.\n\nBecause I have bought the different domains, I have opened those doors to start creating what I want to create, but that is a top down approach. It doesn’t work like that. I need to let this project emerge from what is possible, and what is possible is only discovered as I travel within the limits of what I have done until now. It is only when I open myself to work with other people that I realize the power that lies in the connection with them. It is only by sharing who I am with them that I discover what I have to offer. It is just by giving and sharing myself that I’m able to receive. All this time waiting to do that, from the consumer mindset, and now is the time to shift that and move towards the creator mindset. The creator of your own reality. The true sadhana. That is the life in a festival, that is the life in a meditation retreat. Caring enough about something to stick with it for 21 days, no matter what it is. It can be anything, but just by sticking with it you will transform yourself.\n\nI have been building transformational journeys inside my head, and through my writing, without realizing that I have to start somewhere. With someone. And the people that I contacted today are the ones that will be there at first. Maybe they won’t accept, it is ok, but there will be others that will. It is just for me to open up the door to receive the applications from people that want to be part of this thing. That is the game. To open it up, and let them come in. Have a voyager each day of the week, and through that, learn how to show up myself. It will be food for my understanding of the world, of myself.\n\nWhat a great avenue for just being. Sharing everything that I am for other person to better discover who she is, and evolve in that process. Bring that person into the discovery of the power of Sadhana, of doing the work. Of showing up. Of what comes when you are able to show up, and give it everything that you’ve got. Some days it will be easy, some days it will be hard. But you will be there, showing up, day by day, week after week, and the effort will compound. The single most important aspect of success in the modern world is the capacity to show up, to be consistent. I will build a machine for consistency. For agency. For helping people realize that they can care, if they put enough energy into it.\n\nThat is the whole game that we are learning how to play here, the one of transforming each individual from a consumer to a creator. It is about consuming with intention, to get the most out of it, and from there, create better. It is about giving the energy to mindfully get into the social media of your choice, and realize everything that is brought to your experience because of that. My mission is to use everything that I have been through to help in that process. To help the other person become more of herself, so that she can share that from the heart. The only way on which you can receive is by giving, and this is the most basic truth that is being highlighted from the world that we live in today.\n\nWe have not been able to realize it until now, but for example all those people that give their energy 24/7 to Instagram are literally selling their soul to the devil. They are giving everything that they have to share what they are with the world, and go through a process of understanding who they are because of that.\n\nWhat if instead of doomscrolling through social media you were able to choose the 8 creators that you care about the most and mindfully go through their content, so that you could truly recognize what is powerful in there for you? Not for your kids, not for your partner. For you. Each of us is an individual human being, and in the understading of this there is the power of becoming free. Of wanting to be different. Of fitting. Yes, of fitting, even with the people that are next to us. More with them what with anyone.\n\nWhat if instead of asking ‘How are you?’ we came into a conversation talking about what that person created? My take on the state of things right now is that social media is an obscure aspect of real life. People don’t tend to talk about what they saw in there, because there is like this shy-ness related to sharing that. And where does it come from? Because we don’t like to be seen as pure consumers. We don’t want people to know how long we spend wasting our time doom-scrolling. And it is because people don’t realize the power of creativity. They have been denied this, because of the way on which we have been living until now. There is this eternal noise inside our heads that tells us that we cannot share something if it is not good enough. It needs to be better. It always needs to be better. So we cannot do it. But it is time for that to share, so that we can more from this consumer mindset to the creator mindset. It is all about mindset. It is about creating the conditions for people to realize the power that lies behind the creative act. It is not just about sharing you and your creations, it is about opening a window of transformation within yourself.\n\nIt is about approaching the creative act with intention, and with a deep willingness to discover what amazing thing will come out from there. Always with a beginners mind, with the approach that a child would take towards the world in the steps of first discovering it. “I only know that I don’t know”, that is the essence of the creative act. Of throwing yourself into the void and realizing that it is a feather bed, that is always looking for you, that it is always waiting for you to deep your toe into it. To be transformed. Every time that you create, you open up the door of transformation. And the question that comes now is: Do you really want to be transformed? Are you open to that?\n\nThat is the question that someone needs to ask herself before working with me. Because there will be a transformation. I have opened myself to this transformation deeply, with all the intention that is inside my heart, and it is time for me to share it with the world. This is going to be serious shit. It is going to be the means by which I bring everything that I have become into the world. By shining the light on others. By opening the doors of the power of anonymity also. People are too attached to who they are, because they believe that everything that they could be is determined to the image that they have of themselves. What if they opened up the door for this to be different? Life is becoming more and more virtual, and as this transition continues to get deeper, we are going to be less and less attached to our normal identities. Or at least this window is open, because in the metaverse it doesn’t really matter who you have been, it just matters who you are right now. Which is the value that you are adding to the world, right now? If I create an anon account and share something important that becomes viral, the impact of that sharing will be attached to an identity that is different from the one that I have been attached until now. What is the consequence of that? What is the value of that? Are you able to see it? Are you able to identify yourself in that value? Are you willing to go into that rabbit hole? It is not necessary, but there is amazing potential in what can come from that exploration. You can de-tach who you are (because of your actions) from who you have been (because of your history) and that brings eternal freedom. It is the freedom that I have not been able to enjoy because of the way on which my life has been constructed until now. I am a consequence of everything that has happened before, and a big part of me wants to become free from that. Detached.\n\nIt is not about denying it, it is about integrating it deeply enough that it doesn’t determine who I am really. It is about discovering who I truly am, beyond all the images that I have of myself in my own life experience. At least what comes up right now from that exploration. Is a lot of freedom. Freedom to explore. Freedom to become. Without the expectation of what people are expecting me to be, without the expectation of me expecting to be something particular, but just by sharing who I am in each particular moment.\n\nThat is the most powerful path that I have found myself to be able to walk, and I’m beginning to move towards that understanding of the power of anonymity. Is it a stepping stone into a future on which every one of us is completely comfortable with his real life identity? Is anonymity the step towards full transparency? Maybe. Maybe as we open ourselves to the world through anonymity, we open up the door for truth to come forth through us. And that will bring about the freedom to just be. Whatever we are in that moment. Whatever we can be. Life is an eternal exploration into what is present in that moment. Not into what has been present, or what will be present, but in what truly is. It consists of a perpetual continuum of presents moments, and that is why time is an illusion from the mind. Because it truly doesn’t exist. The moment that we conceptualize something different from what is happening in this present moment, is the moment on which time start to exist. And that is a consequence of the mind. With space is a bit harder to realize, because it is something more tangible. This whole thing is very, very weird. Life is very, very weird, and as we open ourselves to this understanding we go deeper and deeper into the states of being that are more connected to truth. To the truth of what we are, from the depth of what we have been.\n\nWho we have been is a consequence of who we were in a particular moment.\n\nDoes what I’m writing make sense? Does it really matter? I’m not doing it to make sense of anything, I’m just doing it explore the infinite. To explore what is next. To explore what is present right now, and to dive deeper into that exploration, moment after moment. That is the seeking of truth that happens inside me all the time, as I open up to the new understanding of what it means to be alive. Of what it means to be a creative force, that is willing to explore into that by just showing up and writing whatever comes to mind. This is the world that I have built for myself, and it is very nice like this. I really like it. As I come here I realize the power that lies behind these words. Before, I was connected to the internet and a little bit stuck into what to do next. So many options. So many streams of action. But coming here and just writing is the best that I can do to better understand what is going on inside me, because in here there is only one stream of action. There is only one word being written at the time, and that is very, very powerful. It is the same as a painter that grabs the brush, and he has only one option on how to make progress. So he just does it. Without thinking too much about the options, about the shoulds. It shouldn’t be any way different from what it is, because this is the only thing that is truly real. What is going on with the brush, in that exact moment. This word that comes right now, and not any other.\n\nEach word is an exploration into the world, into my world, and it feels like opening the valve for it to happen. For it to be manifested. My mission is to open up that valve for more and more people, so that they can start using social media as a means of discovery of themselves, by truly connecting to the depth of who they are in the process. That is the power of anonymity, of connecting to other people from the heart. Of giving so that you can receive, of maintaining this equilibrium in the universe. That is the power of this whole thing, and realizing that is the strength of all what can be.\n\nThe retreat center that I’m going to build will have one computer for each person that will go in there, and it will be a transformational journey because it will enable them to truly connect with their creative source. It won’t only be a connection with their depth through meditation, it will be a connection to their depth through their creative act. That is the power of all of what is bring created through me, and I’m moving more and more towards the understanding of what this whole thing is. Open up that window, and let it shine through. Let is be discovered, by the power of all of what has been until now.\n\nThe important thing for people to realize is that the creative act is a consequence of everything that they have been until the particular moment on which they start doing it. It is nothing different from that. So that if they are able to delete the ‘should’, and open up to what is, the connection of their truth with the creative act will be established in a clearer manner. There won’t be a mind in the middle expecting it to be different from what it is, there will be only a being that is expressing itself through the creative act. And that is the power of it. Leaving the mind aside, to open up the world for God to create through you. The more disconnected you are from the mind, from time, the more connected you are to the creative source. The more present you are. This whole thing is an exploration into what comes when there is absolute presence of you in the creative act.\n\nIt is what comes when you become dissolved in the creative act. When you become pure presence through it. That is the game that we are learning how to play in Dukkha. That is the main mission of this whole thing. To dissolve what should be, into everything that just is. Just as it is.\n\n--\n\nThere is a feeling of something being dissolved in the inside, as I surrender to the insights that are coming through. This whole thing is a manifesto about Doing The Work, about showing up, and the information that is being written is very powerful. It is the way through. The only way in is through, that is what keeps coming, and we won’t find a way out of social media away from it. The only way in is through, and the way on which we embody that is by developing a mindful relationship to it, so that we can truly understand what is the power behind what is being shared there. What does it mean that each of us has an opportunity to build a window for ourselves to the world? What would it mean to you if you were able to transform your relationship with that window towards one of opening? Of willingness to share your truth, in each particular moment on which it is manifested? It doesn’t matter what your truth is, the only thing that matters is that you share it with your heart.\n\nThat is something that I find amazing about the world we live in. How many marketing experts share what they know for free into the world? How many doctors share tips into how to be healthy? How many people are truly free? Not too many, and my thesis is that it is because there is a lack of connection between what they are doing right now and what their soul wants to express, because they don’t have an avenue to express themselves. They are just being consumed by the day to day activities, without a creative act that brings life to them, by consuming their life force in a way that creates more. The creative act itself is an act of recycling of energy, of building up more through the act of creation. Life itself is just a creative act. Everything that is happening in front of your eyes is a creative act, it is the means by which the universe manifests itself, so that we can tap into it, and with that, become conscious of our own consciousness. I truly believe that consciousness is the most fundamental aspect of reality, and I truly believe that the way on which we can tap into the depth of that aspect is by the creative act.\n\nYes, of course we have to do the hard work of overcoming our biases and the limitations that have been brought into our experience because of the conditioning that we have gone through, but once that is done, the window for creativity is more open than ever. Are you going to walk through it to realize the full potential of everything that you are? Are you going to be able to manifest what you are through the creative act?\n\nAre you willing to stare to the depth of you being and love what you will see in there?\n\nAre you willing to forgive yourself for not being something that you should be?\n\nAre you willing to give up the seeking, and to start exploring into the depth of what is, right here, right now?\n\nAre you willing to give up who you have been, in order to discover who you are, by just being?\n\nAre you willing to express yourself fully through the creative act?\n\nAre you willing to show up?\n\nAre you willing to Do The Work?\n\nIf those questions light up a spark within you, it is just time to do it. There will be never a better time than now.\n\nWelcome to the end of your world. The beginning of all what is.\n\nWelcome to YOUniverse. (You have always been here).\n\nThank you for reading.

So he just does it. Without thinking too much about the options, about the shoulds. It shouldn\\u2019t be any way different from what it is, because this is the only thing that is truly real.

That is the power of anonymity, of connecting to other people from the heart. Of giving so that you can receive, of maintaining this equilibrium in the universe.

There won\\u2019t be a mind in the middle expecting it to be different from what it is, there will be only a being that is expressing itself through the creative act. And that is the power of it. Leaving the mind aside, to open up the world for God to create through you. The more disconnected you are from the mind, from time, the more connected you are to the creative source.

The only way in is through, and the way on which we embody that is by developing a mindful relationship to it, so that we can truly understand what is the power behind what is being shared there. What does it mean that each of us has an opportunity to build a window for ourselves to the world? What would it mean to you if you were able to transform your relationship with that window towards one of opening?

They are just being consumed by the day to day activities, without a creative act that brings life to them, by consuming their life force in a way that creates more. The creative act itself is an act of recycling of energy, of building up more through the act of creation. Life itself is just a creative act. Everything that is happening in front of your eyes is a creative act, it is the means by which the universe manifests itself, so that we can tap into it, and with that, become conscious of our own consciousness.

          "raw": "\nAfter a big delay in the way on which I have been doing things today, here I come, to explore what is right now. I have just read the pre release draft of an institution that is being created by people that seem to have the same intentions that I have, of bringing healing into the world, and there are a lot of feelings that are present in me.\n\nFirst, there is a perceived aspect of disconnection between what they are manifesting in the world, the way on which the message is conveyed, and the ‘normal people’ of the world. It is similar to what happens to me, but in this case it seems to be exacerbated because of the message that they are throwing out. It is very directed to a particular kind of human being, which is connected to this whole awakening path, of better understanding the self, but that language brings separation of itself, because it is impossible for people that are not in the path to understand it. And how can it be translated to normal people? That is what is most needed right now. Not spiritual people connecting with each other to enhance their spirituality, but spiritual people connecting with each other with the purpose of better realize which are the means by which they can connect to the outer world, to the day to day life, so that a transformation can start to take place in the individuals that are part of it. How can life be transformed for the random worker that goes back in the metro, tired of life, but that has to show up again tomorrow to do his thing?\n\nThis is the main question that revolves my being right now, because I can live my whole life doing internal work with people that love doing it, but when is the time on which I face the hard moment of realizing that the whole world is in a different place than this one? This is the truth. There is a big disconnection with where I am at and with the whole world, and the whole thing that I’m doing here is finding out how to gap this disconnection so that more consciousness can be brought up for people that are not necessarily connected to this whole movement. And that is the big mission, and that is why for me, social media is a huge way through this whole thing. I always say, the only way in is through, and by opening the door for people to connect with their creativity there is a window into what can be. Most people don’t connect to it because of fear of it being done wrong, and that is the main aspect by which they don’t connect deeper to themselves.\nCreativity is a window into the connection with the Self. And it has been closed for most of us, for fear of it being done wrong. Always building up from polarities. And that is the window that I want to help open in people. Not the one of building retreats for the eternal seekers. Of course there will be important moments and soul bondings in these, I don’t doubt it, but what is needed is to bring this into the daily life of normal humans, so that a shift in the way on which we relate to each other can be produced. And it is very important to think about which is going to be the entry point for this work in my life. How am I going to progress so that I can get to the people that will have this impact. Who are the entry points in society that can be the starters of this new movement? I always come back to the ones that are depressed. That sole world for me has a lot of information, because it speaks about an existential gap into separation. In the document they spoke about awakened individuals, but what happens with those that are at the complete opposite of that? That want life to truly end for them?\n\nThese people are the entry point. The ones that have had spiritual experiences and are avid for more are living in a dream, one which is apart from the suffering that normal human beings are going through. Art is the way. That is the message that comes more and more. Art is the means by which consciousness realizes itself, because in the pure creative act there are no means for things to be different from what they are. And a lot of artists have had an episode of depression, and that means a lot. Because art has been the means by which they have been able to go out of it. To transcend it by creating from the heart.\n\nThese transformational journeys that I am imagining are the means by which depressed people tap into their creative aspect. And through that, they move towards enlightenment, by the sole pursuit of their craft. There is a big connection because the way on which artists relate to the world, and the practice of spirituality. I have found that this connection is very deep, and by just observing how they behave, I can see that there is a lot into who we are through what they do. I tend to put them on a pedestal, and it is because a lot of the most integral people that I have met are artists. They know their shit. They are Doing The Work. They are inclined to do it, because it is necessary on their path of self discovery. Through this, they become better at their craft. The same as me, coming here to write down these words, going closer to my true self by just letting flow whatever comes. That is the exploration that I want to help bring about. What is present when the boundaries of the ego are dissolved, and you allow yourself to create just for the sake of it.\n\nThe creative act just for the sake of the creative act.\n\nThat is something that it has been truly hard for me to embody, because there is always this aspect of economic well-being that is missing in me. My relationship with money always steps in the way, and I’m not able to transcend it. A lot of energy is stuck in there, and writing these words is my way of finding my way out of it.\n\nArtists are the ones that are in charge of making this transition of humanity into an awakened species. They are the ones that know better. And it is time for them to shine.\n\nOne of the things that came up to me recently is that the mission of what I’m building is for every person in the world to create an NFT. We all will have our own, and the creative act will be the means by which this will happen. Each person giving herself the opportunity to be creative, just for the sake of it.\n\nBut what if I’m bringing myself into a rabbit hole that is not necessary right here? I don’t know. There is really little understanding inside myself related to how to make progress. Everything seems to be moving so fast on the outside, and I’m still not able to make my way through this maze so that I can clarify what I bring into the world. I even don’t know where to start. Which is the next step. Definitely what I made yesterday was a big step forward, sending that email that helped me clarify that what I want to do is to help each person create a digital presence, a digital real estate, that can help her build what she needs to start sharing who she is. And I already have the most important person in the world to work with, who is my wife. I can do this whole process with my heart with her, and share what I learn. With this, we are going to be able to build an amazing thing for her, and I will be able to gather up the knowledge that I need to help other people. We all can be superstars now, and each of us has the information available to do it. Maybe my mission is to point people towards that information. Be able to curate it, so that together we can join forces and thrive.\n\nThat is the mission that resonates right now, the one of helping people to be more of who they are, by creating.\n\nI feel stuck, really stuck. But there is people that are giving me strong feedback, messages, about things being done in a good way. The thing is that I’m not able to earn money with where I am at, I’m just here. Stuck.\n\nI guess that a good starting point is asking: What is the change that I want to make? But the problem with that question is that what comes to mind is everything. In my eyes, everything is in a weird place, in a place different from the optimal. And that makes me waste my time focusing on the big picture, and not in the step that is just in front. What is the next step? What is the smallest next step that I can take to bring about more of who I am into the world?\n\nAnd there comes back the idea of mindful social media. Of doing it with intention, with purpose. But are people going to digest that? Or is it me talking in Chinese more and more?\n\nThat’s it. That is the message that I have seen from all of these social media accounts that share stuff about the exploration of the self, non duality, and such. There seems to be a complexity within what they talk about that makes the message very resistant to the masses. That is why Dan Koe has been so effective with what he does, because he brings about spirituality, but not in a literal way. It is embedded into what he does, but hidden between the layers. And that is the way to go. Realizing that people are not ready for it. They are hesitant. And that is why I keep revolving around the notion of creativity, because that is how I think I can reach more people. By opening them to the window of what comes when they are creative. For them to be constructive with their being. And build something that did not exist before. And the barrier of entry must be low, very low, so that it can happen.\n\nHow it can happen?\n\nIs Dukkha even a good idea? Will people jump into a thing without the knowledge of what it is? Even if the creator doesn’t have any clue about what it is?\n\nThat is the thing. It is very important for me to understand the game that I have been playing, so that I can better get a grasp of where I am at right now. I have been learning how to grow a Twitter audience, so that I can reach more people with my message.\n\nBut what if my message will reach them through other people? The only way in is through. What if the way on which I reach other people is through those that have already established their audience? Maybe this is the way. This is the means by which this thing happens. Helping the creators that have already established their audience to build up the means to better connect with that audience, so that there can be a communication that can enhance life overall.\n\nEach creator has an audience that follows them because of something. What is that I can create that can be the means by which this audience is leveraged in a concrete way so that something can happen from this interaction?\n\nLet’s think about Noxx, and amazing 3D artist with which I have interacted on Twitter. He has 13k followers, a lot of which are other artists that are very inspired by his work. He interacts a lot with his audience, and that is very powerful. He has a big following. He wants to make a living out of this thing. He just wants to create. That reminds me of myself. I just want to create. I just want to build up geometric worlds with which people can delight themselves. There is an aspect of me that just wants to come to the computer, draw stuff, and have fun. And I’m not letting that aspect express itself because of all the noise trying to fit. Trying to build something that is already happening. The ecosystem is already moving. It is already going on. I have not been able to realize it yet, but it is already moving on, towards the infinite. Worlds of creations, worlds of expression, that are being built through the internet by people that are already where I want to be. But I am where I am at. It has always been perfect like this.\n\nWhat if I just create what wants to be created, and move on from there? What if this system comes into being through me, I built it robustely, and help myself become free? Artists are the ones that carry out the future. What about doing generative art with code and geometry? Maybe that is the thing. Perpetual motion into the exploration of the present moment, from a circle into the infinite.\n\nI haven’t created art in a while. And maybe that is the thing. Holy shit, this is more noise coming in. What a crazy session this is, with all this noise, with all this willingness to express something and that is not being too helpful in that. I mean, yes, there is expression, but what is it about?\n\nThat is the thing, I’m just losing it here. And it is a good question to ask, what has brought me here today?\n\nSee the big picture. Open your eyes, and enable yourself to see the big picture. I probably feel the way I do because of the disappointment that it has brought to me to have my teacher fail. I don’t want to feel this way. Why should I expose myself to that? I don’t deserve it. I have given my best, and it is important for me to take action and care about myself enough so that I don’t let this happen freely. It is not something good. I need to take action. I need to make some progress in the direction of freedom. And I now is when I come back to what Dukkha is about. Stay on track, my friend. It is time for that.\n\nSo the main intention behind this project is to build a response to the eternal quest for transformational festivals and meditation retreats. How can life become that? Or do we really need these kinds of interactions to exist in an harmonic way? I truly don’t think so, and I’m looking for the understanding of how to build this. How to drop this snowball from the mountain so that it can be something powerful, strong, and consistent in time. It is crazy to think about what Satoshi Nakamoto started with bitcoin. He threw that snowball, and it has been growing and growing through the world. And making its impact. What is what I’m trying to create here?\n\nThe means for each person to be an artist, and that is my journey. From being an engineer to an artist. I truly want to be an artist, and be able to express all of who I am in a craft that can delight the eyes of those who want to be the witness. Merge everything that I am into amazing creations. But even writing this is still in the line of what I have always strived for and brings suffering, which is the identification with something specific. Why do I need to fall into categories? Why should I define myself as an artist? Is it even necessary? In 21 days of 4 hours of deep work, I can end up having 84 hours of doing the craft. Is that what I want to do? And how do I want to do it? With a different software every time, so that I can be always learning something new. I’m just writing stuff that is not connected one with each other, all of what I have written today is noise. And it is perfect like that, because that noise is what is present inside me. There is a lot of noise. A lot of uncertainty. A lot of willingness to do stuff, but a lack of understanding of how to do it. What is the next step forward. I feel dizzy, I feel nervous. There is a lot of anxiety present. But let’s go back to Dukkha, and see what comes up.\n\nSo what I think about this project is setting up the ground for the transformational journeys, which will take the people that will be part of them into a way of existing that is at the intersection of a meditation retreat and a transformational festival. It is about approaching life from the perspective of a human being that brings out the most of it.\n\nThoughts of David Foster Wallace come up. The amazing books that he wrote, and the depth of all of them. And all of that was because of his depression. Was it a necessary stepping stone into the evolution of humanity? Did he need what I’m trying to build to be able to create what he created? Nope, he didn’t. But it was probably because he was able to create systems for himself for going through the resistance. What happens for normal people that have trouble going through those initial steps of resistance?\n\nHow can I reach out to depressed people so that I can better understand what they are going through, and if this is going to help them in any way? Am I the one that will help them? Is that even possible? Maybe I am depressed myself and I don’t know how to help me. I don’t want to help them. I want to help us. I want to build a system for all of us to help each other. Maybe that is what the whole NFT ecosystem has brought to the world, the means by which artists from all over the world are able to help each other, and build community. Before this wave, for them to sell their work was much harder, obscure. NFT’s gives them a window, an opportunity, and that is very valuable. It is truly changing the world, by opening it to those that want to dive into their creative self. Am I one of those? Yes, I am. For sure. But what is that that I am creating? I don’t even know.\n\nThe world is open, and each avenue is a new opportunity for creating. There is less clarity than ever before, and it is getting more and more confusing. How am I sharing myself with the world? How is my message reaching out? That is something that I need to better realize, so that I can more on with that understanding. With that knowing.\n\nI’m on the journey of creating my first NFT. My first digital asset. I haven’t done it yet, and I really want to know so that I can have more stuff published out there that people can interact with. Which is the best software for drawing geometry? Is this even the right question?\n\nHoly shit, the world is fucking confusing. For sure it was much easier to be the son of a shoemaker and just continue with what he had done always. For sure it is easy to go to university and just continue with the path that life shows you in front. Realizing what to do is just too hard. And much more because it requires a level of commitment that I have not been able to achieve. With anything. Well, I think I’m getting there with my family, and probably that is the most important one. But in the other aspects, I have not been able, and it is tough! I just go from one point to the other one. Picking here, picking there, like a hummingbird. When will this stop?\n\nI thought Dukkha was the answer, but there are doubts present right now even related to that.\n\nIt doesn’t matter. It is perfect as it is. I showed up, I did the work, and that is all that matters. It will work out for itself.\n",

I have found that this connection is very deep, and by just observing how they behave, I can see that there is a lot into who we are through what they do. I tend to put them on a pedestal, and it is because a lot of the most integral people that I have met are artists. They know their shit. They are Doing The Work. They are inclined to do it, because it is necessary on their path of self discovery. Through this, they become better at their craft. The same as me, coming here to write down these words, going closer to my true self by just letting flow whatever comes. That is the exploration that I want to help bring about. What is present when the boundaries of the ego are dissolved, and you allow yourself to create just for the sake of it.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"The creative act just for the sake of the creative act.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"That is something that it has been truly hard for me to embody, because there is always this aspect of economic well-being that is missing in me. My relationship with money always steps in the way, and I\\u2019m not able to transcend it. A lot of energy is stuck in there, and writing these words is my way of finding my way out of it.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Artists are the ones that are in charge of making this transition of humanity into an awakened species. They are the ones that know better. And it is time for them to shine.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"One of the things that came up to me recently is that the mission of what I\\u2019m building is for every person in the world to create an NFT.

Each person giving herself the opportunity to be creative, just for the sake of it.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"But what if I\\u2019m bringing myself into a rabbit hole that is not necessary right here? I don\\u2019t know. There is really little understanding inside myself related to how to make progress. Everything seems to be moving so fast on the outside, and I\\u2019m still not able to make my way through this maze so that I can clarify what I bring into the world. I even don\\u2019t know where to start. Which is the next step. Definitely what I made yesterday was a big step forward, sending that email that helped me clarify that what I want to do is to help each person create a digital presence, a digital real estate, that can help her build what she needs to start sharing who she is. And I already have the most important person in the world to work with, who is my wife. I can do this whole process with my heart with her, and share what I learn. With this, we are going to be able to build an amazing thing for her, and I will be able to gather up the knowledge that I need to help other people. We all can be superstars now, and each of us has the information available to do it. Maybe my mission is to point people towards that information. Be able to curate it, so that together we can join forces and thrive.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"That is the mission that resonates right now, the one of helping people to be more of who they are, by creating.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"I feel stuck, really stuck.

Stuck.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"I guess that a good starting point is asking: What is the change that I want to make? But the problem with that question is that what comes to mind is everything. In my eyes, everything is in a weird place, in a place different from the optimal.

What is the smallest next step that I can take to bring about more of who I am into the world?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And there comes back the idea of mindful social media.

That is the message that I have seen from all of these social media accounts that share stuff about the exploration of the self, non duality, and such. There seems to be a complexity within what they talk about that makes the message very resistant to the masses. That is why Dan Koe has been so effective with what he does, because he brings about spirituality, but not in a literal way. It is embedded into what he does, but hidden between the layers. And that is the way to go. Realizing that people are not ready for it. They are hesitant. And that is why I keep revolving around the notion of creativity, because that is how I think I can reach more people. By opening them to the window of what comes when they are creative. For them to be constructive with their being. And build something that did not exist before. And the barrier of entry must be low, very low, so that it can happen.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"How it can happen?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Is Dukkha even a good idea?

He has 13k followers, a lot of which are other artists that are very inspired by his work. He interacts a lot with his audience, and that is very powerful. He has a big following. He wants to make a living out of this thing. He just wants to create. That reminds me of myself. I just want to create. I just want to build up geometric worlds with which people can delight themselves. There is an aspect of me that just wants to come to the computer, draw stuff, and have fun. And I\\u2019m not letting that aspect express itself because of all the noise trying to fit. Trying to build something that is already happening. The ecosystem is already moving. It is already going on. I have not been able to realize it yet, but it is already moving on, towards the infinite. Worlds of creations, worlds of expression, that are being built through the internet by people that are already where I want to be. But I am where I am at. It has always been perfect like this.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"What if I just create what wants to be created, and move on from there?

I don\\u2019t deserve it. I have given my best, and it is important for me to take action and care about myself enough so that I don\\u2019t let this happen freely. It is not something good. I need to take action. I need to make some progress in the direction of freedom. And I now is when I come back to what Dukkha is about. Stay on track, my friend. It is time for that.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So the main intention behind this project is to build a response to the eternal quest for transformational festivals and meditation retreats. How can life become that? Or do we really need these kinds of interactions to exist in an harmonic way? I truly don\\u2019t think so, and I\\u2019m looking for the understanding of how to build this. How to drop this snowball from the mountain so that it can be something powerful, strong, and consistent in time. It is crazy to think about what Satoshi Nakamoto started with bitcoin. He threw that snowball, and it has been growing and growing through the world. And making its impact.

But even writing this is still in the line of what I have always strived for and brings suffering, which is the identification with something specific. Why do I need to fall into categories? Why should I define myself as an artist? Is it even necessary? In 21 days of 4 hours of deep work, I can end up having 84 hours of doing the craft. Is that what I want to do? And how do I want to do it? With a different software every time, so that I can be always learning something new. I\\u2019m just writing stuff that is not connected one with each other, all of what I have written today is noise. And it is perfect like that, because that noise is what is present inside me. There is a lot of noise. A lot of uncertainty. A lot of willingness to do stuff, but a lack of understanding of how to do it. What is the next step forward. I feel dizzy, I feel nervous.

The amazing books that he wrote, and the depth of all of them. And all of that was because of his depression. Was it a necessary stepping stone into the evolution of humanity? Did he need what I\\u2019m trying to build to be able to create what he created? Nope, he didn\\u2019t. But it was probably because he was able to create systems for himself for going through the resistance. What happens for normal people that have trouble going through those initial steps of resistance?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"How can I reach out to depressed people so that I can better understand what they are going through, and if this is going to help them in any way?

I want to build a system for all of us to help each other. Maybe that is what the whole NFT ecosystem has brought to the world, the means by which artists from all over the world are able to help each other, and build community. Before this wave, for them to sell their work was much harder, obscure. NFT\\u2019s gives them a window, an opportunity, and that is very valuable. It is truly changing the world, by opening it to those that want to dive into their creative self. Am I one of those? Yes, I am. For sure. But what is that that I am creating?

Well, I think I\\u2019m getting there with my family, and probably that is the most important one. But in the other aspects, I have not been able, and it is tough!

          "raw": "\nThis writing is an exploration into the void. Into what is left behind my thoughts after having experienced the work that has been published to the world by Eric. I came across his work yesterday, and there is a deep resonance present in me related to it. That’s why I read parts of it with intention, with all of what I am, so that I could bring it towards the aspect of my unconscious experience so that it can be brought up during this writing-thought process. I’m giving the command to my rational brain to step apart at this moment, so that the truth can come forth. My own truth. My own digestion of where I am at right now, after all the steps that I have walked in my own experience as a human being.\n\nEvery one of those steps is a building block that brings me into what I am right now, and into the capacity that I have for creating reality from that place. Because yes, every word that is written in this moment is an aspect of where I am at right now. It is the translation of the present moment through the lens of this experience. It is how consciousness has shaped reality through me as an individual, and I write in the hope of being able to use that shaping in a way that is conducent to a pure expression of consciousness through it. I leave myself at the side, so that what remains talks.\n\nAnd yes, that is what is present. The necessity for building systems of culture that enable that flourishing of the individuals through the creative expression. That is something that I miss from everything that I have read. I deeply resonate with the need for building new means of working out our experience as human beings, but how those means are translated into the daily experience of the normal worker that doesn’t even have money for buying the bread to feed his family? How can that individual be actualize so that he can be the means by which more of what we are can be expressed?\n\nI am part of the lucky few. Life has given me the means for me to live at my own expenses, without any material need at all. Everything that I need from that standpoint has already been provided, and that is the place from which I think, from which I design. I have an amazing and supportive family, I have a beautiful and healthy daughter, and from there I’m able to realize that the biggest aspect of what I can aspire to is realizing the truth of my being.\n\nBut what happens to the gardener that was put into the hospital the other day and had a surgery on which he didn’t have any piece of opinion because of his lack of education?\nWhat happens to the priest (friend of my grandmother) that commited suicide yesterday next to the church?\nWhat happens to all of those people that are buried into depression and that don’t see the way out?\nWhat happens to all of those people that go back to their poor houses in the metro finding in the eternal noise of facebook an escape to their own pain, to the misery of their life?\n\nHow can this healing reach them?\n\nThey are the majority of the ones that are alive right now, and it is through them that the biggest changes can happen. Historically, for them religion has been that escape. At least where I live, there is a tendency for poor people to trust in religion as the means for them to be saved. It is like the excuse that life gives them for their misery. And I guess that that has been a major role that religion has played until now. To build those kinds of individuals into the ones that follow the rules, the ones that do their thing because they just have to do it. They don’t have any other option.\n\nBut do they really don’t have other option?\n\nWhat I’m aiming towards with all this questioning without myself is: Do they really don’t have any other option?\n\nHow can we co-create that option?\n\nWhat is most present in me usually is that the means for freedom are inside the word. They are free.\n\nIf you want to have better health, east less: fast.\nIf you want to have a deeper connection with yourself, meditate, breathe.\n\nI’m sure that life cannot be this unfair. Because of having been born where I was, I was able to take a plane to Canada and go to the deepest meditation retreat that I have gone. But how can the connection with spirit be available only to those that can afford that? Of course not. It can’t be. How can it be that the connection with spirit is available only for those that have enough money to pay for it? Nope, it can’t work like that. Life is not unfair. It is showing us the way, and the only way in is through.\n\nI think that creativity plays a major role in this whole game. Most of those people when they are in the train are consumers. They are feeding their experience with what other people are doing, they are just being entertained. This doesn’t bring anything particularly good to them more than noise. Numbness. They are comfortably numb, because they don’t know any better.\n\nHow can the connection with spirit be fostered for those who don’t know how to read?\nWhat is the place from which they are the ones that evolve, that become self-sovereign individuals?\n\nWe need a shift in perspective to how we relate to reality, and I think that a major entering point to this can be through the people that are depressed. There is a big avenue in them, because they are growing in number, and a big part of those are desperate. They don’t know the way out. They are absolutely identified by their ego, and that makes them think that that is the only thing that exists. They are at the end of the spectrum of identification with ego, and self-sovereign individuals are at the complete opposite. But is it truly a spectrum? Is is truly at the other side?\n\nI don’t think so. What my heart and intuition tells me is that it is more of a moebius tape. I’m certain than the most depressed a person is, the closer she is to awakening. The ego structure is so solidified, so strong, that it is easier for that one to be dropped out than for mine, for example. My ego structure has been bullied a lot by that aspect of me that knows it isn’t true, and that’s why this battle inside me has been going on for such a long time. I know that there is something else, but I don’t know how to look for it. And I keep looking and searching for that realization, and I’m absolutely trapped in that maze. That is what happens when you have enough time to deepen your relationship with this whole aspect of realizing your true self, you end up in this maze, putting all the effort into the seeking. And what needs to happen is that the seeking must be dropped. Easier said than done.\n\nBut for this people that don’t have any idea, any clue about this whole ego construct and awakening and enlightenment and stuff, my heart tells me that it is way way much ‘easier’. It is just about realizing the means by which it can be done at a civilization scale. Which is the set of practices that can be developed in order to wake up a random dude that is in the metro going back to his house after a tough day at the factory? That is what we need to search. That is what needs to happen. Because as soon as we reach a critical mass of awakened people, it will become an exponential process. For someone to wake up in presence of an awakened individual it is much easier, so the key will be how to develop this kind of system. That is why, in my eyes, the approach has to be from the ground, from the very ground, up. And that is the major challenge. How can those people wake up? And how can they stay awake? What comes after that?\n\nAn explosion of creativity. And society needs to develop the means for that creativity to be used as a means for generating wealth, so that they can make a living out of their new way of living life. At this moment, there is no space for that. We are into the trap of consumption and mass production and lack of quality and all what is present now. What comes at the other side? I don’t think we can build up that system from the outside. It needs to be developed from the inside. If you go to a farmers market, they know how to do their thing. They have been bartening all their life. And here we come, modern citizens from the big cities, trying to reinvent the wheel. How much of that is our own ego of being the saviors of the world? And I’m inside that bag also. I’m very deep in it. A huge part of me thinks that it is my duty to develop the technology, the means of communication, for that transformation to happen. Because of everything that I have been given, it is my mission. For all my self-actualization, it is my mission to actualize other human beings. Am I deep into my own trap? I wonder. I ponder it.\n\nI come into the internet and read all this amazing things that are being developed to heal the world, and then I go back to that gardener and realize how far the way on which he lives is to what is being developed in what I was reading. And I wonder. How is this gap closed? How is this new way of thinking materialized in a way that it impacts the biggest part of the population?\n\nBecause yes, creating a new culture is an amazing idea, I’m all into it, but how does that culture impact the person that is watching the news to avoid feeling what she has inside? How can that person truly be healed so that consciousness can arise through her actions? How can we bring healing to the moms and pops of the world? How can I help heal my grandmother, who is a rock which has never shared any emotion with me? How is are all the insights that I have inside translated into a way of doing, of creating, of manifesting, that has an impact in the life of all this people that will never go to a transformational retreat? Are we tackling the problem from the right side?\n\nThose are questions that arise clearly within me, because I truly don’t see how this message can be translated into their language. And I spend a long time with them. I ask them questions, I try to be empathetic with them. But how could I truly know how they feel? How could I truly know how it feels to not have money to put the bread in the table? How can I truly embody what they need so that they can realize that their ego is a construct of their experience as a human being, and that they are much more than what they think?\n\nWhich is the way out of that? How is that culture built?\n\nI truly don’t know, and writing this down is just an exploration into that. Into what comes from those questions as pointers within myself.\n\nAnd it is that it is not my duty. I’m trying to put on my back all the burden of having to fix something, when there is nothing to be fixed. Probably what needs more space for being fixed is the fact that I generally refer as them as ‘them’, generating into my reality a notion of separation that puts me away from who they are in my own life.\n\n--\n\nThere are certain truths about how the world works right now, and at least those come up right now as the means for exploring paths forward. Each city, each small village has people. Old people, young people. There is an aspect of beauty that each of us enjoy within, and that connects us with joy. And that aspect is creation. I remember my grandmother talking to me about the nicest event that she witnessed as a young woman, and it was the party of the umbrellas. Once a year, people would create their own umbrellas and go out to the street and share them with the others. That brught a deep sense of belonging, of being part of the city, that is lost right now. It bonded old people with young ones. The schools with the community. And perharps that is what is needed. To use technology to create the means for this to happen again. In each community.\n\nWhat if there was a network of stewards in every part of the world who were in charge of building this kind of events? That is what a carnival is about. An exploration into the joy of being alive. Of belonging. That is what people need, a sense of belonging. All the aspects of belonging that have existed until now have been dissolved, and we have less and less places where to anchor ourselves. We feel isolated. But is that even true? Because of the internet, I can meet people that resonate with the message that I want to bring into the world, and that helps me belong. Do I really feel isolated? I’m not sure. What I would like to have is a group of people with which I could share who I am without caring about what they would think, and I have not built that for myself in the place where I live. I have not reached out. I have not created that network for myself. ‘Build it, and they will come’. What am I waiting to build it?\n\nThat’s a good question. I just keep throwing the ball to the future. And how could a network of stewards around the world help me gather the strength that is needed to create a local thing in my village that can help the transition into this new world?\n\nWhat comes now is a small store downtown, which sole purpose is the pursuit of truth. Of the truth of every one that enters. A small store that is an invitation to explore. How can that be paralleled into what a church has historically been? The church is a place for worshipping, for connecting with the divine. To rest in the divine. It is the place where people go to so that they can be free from the burden of being themselves. Is that really it? Is that a burden? Is that something that weights over their shoulders? I’m not sure. I’m just thinking out loud, and probably what is coming is not too connected to reality. But through this exploration I better understand what is inside me. All the judgements. Since I started writing today I have been judging ‘them’. Those are the ones that need help. They are the ones that are closer to realization because they are the ones that are depressed. And when is the moment on which I realize that I’m not far away from that? I may have all the money that I need, but there is a deep need inside me that has not been met yet, and this is the way on which it is expressed.\n\nYes. That is the need. The need for expression. For having the means for what I have inside to come out, to be expansive. To reach other people. I realize who I am by interacting with people like you. That is something that comes often. We realize who we are by interacting with others. How does modern society help us connect with each other? How is culture built because of the interaction between each other? Is culture a consequence? Is it something static that is built? I don’t think so. It is the consequence of the interaction. Culture is built every second because of the interaction that each of us has with his own life, and with the others.\n\nHow can this be transformed so that the building blocks of society are more solid, and from there the generation function, frequency can create systems that are regenerative and more helpful to bring about the truth of who we are?\n\nI have not even been able to have a nice interaction with my father and I’m throwing all of these words outside. What needs to happen is an internal change. One which is in resonance to what is happening in the world. The analogy of the bridge comes in again. Should I shout from the side of the bridge on which I am, or should I go to the side where they are, realize how they are relating to each other and themselves, and from there start building?\n\nWhich aspect of myself wants to build the new way of doing things from a place that is separate of them? What happens if I consciously ‘lower’ my frequency so that I can resonate in ‘their’ frequency and through that be able to realize how to better spread my own message? Is there a fear that my message will be lost if I go in there and resonate with theirs? Which aspect of separation is present when I keep speaking about ‘them’, as if they were something different from what I am?\n\nWhat is present in these words? What I’m not being able to see? Who is the one that is writing?\n\nThere is a deep need for helping. But helping who? Helping how?\n\nWhich is the role that I play in this whole maze?\n\nProbably the one that is coming through as I write these words. The one that understand that this whole thing is a maze, and that no one has the answer to what comes. There is an urgency to help. But does the world really need my help? I guess that the question to ask right now is:\n\nWhere is that help coming from?\n\nBecause when I write ‘them’, I’m speaking from a place of separation. How can I integrate that so that I can speak from a place of ‘us’? What are the aspects of life that are present in all of us?\n\nWe were all born as a consequence of a feminine and masculine figure.\nWe all breathe.\nWe all have a heart that beats.\nWe all have good moments, we all have bad moments.\n\nThe judgement that arises towards myself right now is that this is too simplistic. It should be more complex. How couldn’t I come up with more aspects of what brings us together?\n\nWe are all human.\n\nNo matter where we are from, we are all human. And each of us is a manifestation from the divine, which is brought into life as we open up the door for creativity to shine through. To create something that didn’t exist before, and help each other in that process. That is something amazing that happens right now. My wife has been this last two days watching youtube videos of people helping her to knit (?) crochet, and that is open information related to how to create. We all want to help others to create. That is what we came here for. To create. And there is a deep need inside us to express who we are by creating. How can that need be manifested in each human being? What happens when each of us allows himself or herself to just create for the sake of it? I truly don’t know, and that is the magic. Working each day with something new, with a new aspect of yourself, so that everything that you are in that particular moment shines through the creation itself.\n\nThe religion of the future is creativity, and the creative act is the means by which we transcend ourselves in service of the divine. That is something that is present most of all in artists, but there needs to be means for that to be apprehended in a collective scale. How would the world look life if each human being allowed himself to be creative? Yes. That is what is present.\n\nBut now what also comes it the healing part. All of us has a deep need for healing. What if we organized the world to have a healing year? What if all the resources for the world were put in service of this mission? Can we stop the world and devote all the resources towards the pursuit of this mission? How long does the healing of a human being take? How much time do they need? Of course this is a dream that doesn’t have any grounding with reality, but it is a fun exercise to think about. What if we all held the space for the healing of each of us. Maybe we could take shifts. 10% of the population one month, then the other 10%, and so on, until we are all healed. How would that world look like?\n\nIt is nice to dream. I mean, not even that nice. All of this what I’m saying is not grounded at all in reality, because the truth is that most of humanity doesn’t even know that there is something as ‘healing’ available to us.\n\n--\n\n## I started writing today with the intention of digesting what I have read about Eric and the Phoenix Culture project, and all of the Rebirth and Cultural architecture, and this is what has come up. This is the biggest expression of how all over the place I am at. Sorry about that, it is not easy for me to organize in a proper way what I convey as information. It is just a stream of consciousness, with the intention of processing what is inside me through it.\n\nShould I really try to organize all this? Is it even necessary? Because the deep intention with what I’m writing here is not to give answers… It is to raise more questions. All of this is a pointer towards something that doesn’t exist yet, so in that sense it doesn’t matter if I give organized information or not. The important thing is that I raise questions, that can be used as the vehicle for further exploration. Into what? Into the ways on which to achieve the mission that want to be achieved. Which is that mission? The purest expression of who each of us is.\n\nI move closer towards that mission inside myself when I sit down and write whatever comes up. That is the means that I have discovered right now to explore. But what happens later, I truly don’t know. It is part of what is in the void, waiting to be dug. It is dug? Probably not. It is brought forth. Does it even exist? Are the words that are going to be written in 10 more minutes existing somewhere, or they are just a manifestation that comes forth as they are written? Is there even a way on which to apprehend this? The mind wants to know, but it truly doesn’t even matter. It is part of the mistery, and the more you try to understand it, the more it lacks sense.\n\nSo the important part of everything that I read from Eric is not the information itself, it is what the information is pointing towards. It is how it transforms the way on which I relate to reality, by realizing that there is someone in the world that is willing to write about that. That that energy is being moved in a particular way. May it be the answer or not, it doesn’t really matter. The important aspect of it is what it brings. That is the important part of the internet, of us to sharing our creations. It really doesn’t matter if it is true or not, what matters is the consequence that it has in the consciousness of another individual. Because as that consciousness is opened more and more through the creative act, there is a window from which more truth can come forth. And with that, the vortex keeps going. It keeps expanding. That’s why it is so important to foster creativity, because it is what brings up the magic.\n\nAs more and more people open up their creative brain, more and more of them is expressed through what they bring forth. That is what comes. More and more of the magic of every individual shining through the fear of stuff not being good.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if it is good or bad. It just matters that it is.\n",

That is what needs to happen. Because as soon as we reach a critical mass of awakened people, it will become an exponential process. For someone to wake up in presence of an awakened individual it is much easier, so the key will be how to develop this kind of system.

          "raw": "\nThere is a deep curiosity present today related to how is this going to play out. What comes to mind is moments at school, on which we went to CALL class, where the computers were. In there, we learned English, with a software that was very boring to use. What if they taught us something more interesting? How would that end up looking? What if the system that I’m creating is a network of computer education, for people from all ages? That is it, teaching people how to use computers. From the young ones to the old ones. We all can learn something. There is an aspect of what can be done with computers that can be novel to each and every one of us, and in that, there is an exploration into the creative aspect that each of us has inside.\n\nComputers as the means for developing creativity. That is something new. And the consequence of that exploration into the creative part of each one of us is a NFT, which then can be published and sold so that the person can connect with what was inside. If it is a 6yo, it can be sold to his parents, grandparents, etc. It can be part of the marketplace. It truly doesn’t matter, the only thing that matters is that it exists. What a great idea, having this rooms full of computers so that people can go in there and educate themselves. 90 minutes of full on concentration, bringing about the best that they can. That is something that is always present in me, how to connect the magic of web3 and what is happening in that ecosystem with the real world, where people can flourish because of the consequences of what being inside the internet brought to them.\n\nWe go to the internet to expand who we are, so that then we can go out of it and connect to our surroundings in a more sincere way. We go into the internet to become more of who we are. The internet is the means by which we better understand who we are, so that then when we disconnect from it we can offer more of that to each and every one of the interactions that happens offline. That is where we are heading to.\n\nThat’s why it is so important to develop community activities that people can relate to in the place where they are at. I predict that in the close future people will go more and more away from cities, and live in places of the countryside where they will be able to live in a different way. More connected to nature, and with a bigger balance between online and offline. When this happens, it will be of major importance to develop means for them to connect with each other on the physical realm, and that is part of the spirit that is being brought up here, in this manifesto. It is very important to be able to balance all the aspects of our existence as humans, and a big part of it is related to how we show up to ourselves and our community when we are not connected.\n\nThere is a big aspect of myself that wants to explore this, and learn more about life from the standpoint of those who are close. It doesn’t matter truly if there is resonance between the view of the world, because each part of that dissonance is information that can be helpful for the evolution of each individual. If I go to a place and there is noise present in me related to being there, I can use that noise as a means for deepening the exploration of myself. The internet can induce going into the rabbit hole of only relating to people that I feel comfortable with, and that can be harmful because I don’t expose myself to the uncomfortable. And the uncomfortable is important, because a big aspect of growth comes from there. So there needs to be this balance between the online and the offline, and part of what is being brought up in this document is related to that.\n\nHow to use the tools of this day and age to evolve as human beings? What does that evolution even look like? It’s crazy, because we relate to people from all over the world, without even knowing which are the physical circumstances on which that person lives. He may live in the countryside. She may live in the city. On an apartment. On a big house. Who knows. It is part of the mistery, but we tend to create this ‘one size fits all’ ways of building health for example, on which there is a health plan built for a particular kind of person, and we don’t have into consideration which is the particular way of living that that person has. Holy shit, again I’m all over the place, because I want to fix everything. I want to develop the means for helping each one of us, in every realm, in every way. And that doesn’t help me to be focused. And I know that I have to be focused. Which is going to be my main focus? How will I create all of what I’m creating?\n\nWhat makes more sense right now is to start the next transformational journey working with a new software, and exploring it as much as I can during those 21 days. Creating with it an NFT, and developing a community of learning around the craft for those 21 days. I will create a new twitter profile and follow all the leaders in that domain, so that with that I can explore into the knowledge of that particular thing. I will create from the heart, exploring what comes. Being present in each moment, and just building from there. That will be the means by which I learn to learn. I learn to learn by giving myself the space to create. To just be there. Is that the right path? Is it a good idea? I’m not sure about it, it is what comes right now, but I’m not sure if it is a good idea or not.\n\nI’m running in circles with that one. It doesn’t make too much sense, but here I am, running in that circle, trying to explore one more of the many, many ideas that are here in myself. It is cold, the day is starting, and I’m not too connected with what is being written.\n\nMaybe it is time to speak about my meditation. It seems that there is something that is being fixed inside me, as if the samskaras that are being integrated are inside the brain. I sit down and sometimes I feel very weird movements of energy inside the brain, and it is crazy. There is a particular level of feeling stuck, like wanting to experience something more, something deeper, but not being able to reach that place. There is an aspect of myself that knows that I need to give up that search, that quest, and that is what I’m exploring with the practice. But it is very hard. It is crazy how such a simple practice is so challenging, and it is crazy how much of my whole system is being rewired in the process. I feel and know that my nervous system is being built again, and everything that happens is just part of the process. I just need to show up, and be there going through it.\n\nMeditation is the means by which I apprehend in an experiential level the aspect of reality that is most connected to truth: That everything is changing. By sitting down and just being a witness of what comes up, I open up to that field of change, and I become part of it. These days I’m not even using a meditation object, I just go with whatever comes up and stare it. It is amazing. It connects me with the whole history of humanity, because it is a practice that could have been done 2000 years ago the same as I do it now, and that is the amazing part of it. It connects me with every human being that has existed in the history of humanity. It brings humility, and patience, and care. It brings joy, it brings curiosity, and wonder. Yes, a big part of it is connected to wonder. To the wonder to be there to be the witness of whatever will come up.\n\nTo show up, and be the witness of what comes up. You will never know, it is always different. The practice is just being there for it. Exploring it. And being equanimous in that exploration.\n\n--\n\nSo was I talking about my process of creating a DAO? Of this process of gathering everything that I am, everything that I have been, into the creation of something that can be manifested in the world? Isn’t that what this whole document is about? Yesterday I read what I wrote for the first two days, and I really like the way on which I write. It may be that this will be useless in the future, but the fact that I can come back here and just realize the way on which I was thinking and talking to myself at this moment of my life, is just incredible. These words are the manifesto of my own mind, of the way on which I think and relate to everything that happens in my life, and in that sense, it is magical. It doesn’t really matter if I’m running in circles, it doesn’t matter if it doesn’t make any sense. The only thing that matters is that it exists. It is that I come here and show up and just write what comes. Something is moving because of that, something is going on, and this writing is an invitation to that openness. I can’t pretend to be anyone different from what I am, and in that sense, the creative process is a reflection.\n\nWhen you create, you can’t pretend. There truth, your truth, comes forth, because you can’t create something that you are not. As you empty yourself and your expectations of what should be manifested through you, you end up realizing that you can’t pretend. You are what you are, and it is perfect like that. That is what we need really. People that are willing to go into that process of exploration to bring about who they are through the act of creation. That is how more and more consciousness will be developed, as people free themselves from shoulds, and open to ares. The end of shoulds. That is the game that we are playing here, imagining a world in which that word doesn’t exist anymore. And it plays itself even in what I’m writing right now, because a lot of what I have written today is just nonsense, but it truly doesn’t matter. The part of myself that says that it is nonsense is the one that judges, and the part of myself that is proud about this is the one that is willing to show up with the truth. This is the truth of what I am today, this is who I am, and it is perfect like that. I acknowledge it, I celebrate it, I embrace it. It is amazing as it is.\n\nHaving the opportunity to share my work with the open space brings the feelings of being exposed. Of not trusting. Of being nervous. Of feeling like an imposter. How many people have never shared their work? I can think about the closest example that I have, my mother. She plays her game on Instagram, always looking to what is going on from behind the mirror, always being a consumer, and not a creator. I truly wonder: What needs to happen for her to become a creator in there? What is missing in her life experience that she finds comfort in that aspect, instead of in the one of sharing her creations so that she can help others?\n\nIt is crazy how in our surroundigs there can always be example of things that are going on and that can inform the way on which we do things. Or inform what we think about if we just open to that. Everything that I’m developing here as ideas related to the transition between consumer to creator can be applied to my own life, on which people that are very close to me are just consumers. What needs to happen in their experience for them to shift this? Is is something that they truly want? A big part of me tells me that yes, they want it. They just don’t know how good it feels. They don’t want to be exposed. They don’t want to be criticized.\n\nWhy not? What has happened throughout our life that there is such a big resistance for criticism? What does being criticized bring into us? It is related to those basic needs that we have. Of being part of the tribe. A big part of us is fearful of sharing what we have created because we worry about being left out of the tribe. That is what the critic brings. Throwing us out of the tribe. But the thing that they don’t realize is that if they open themselves to share their work, they open up the door for another tribe. One that resonates with that work. And that brings up a deeper level of connetion, of meaning, of community, that was not experienced before. So yes, that is what happens. A person creates something new, she doesn’t want to share it because of fear to this criticism from the tribe, and then she finally crosses this threshold to find out at the other side the meaning that comes from finding her tribe.\n\nThey don’t know how it works, because they have never experienced it. How could my mother know how it feels to be part of a community, if in a long time she hasn’t been part of it? Is it really something that she needs? Is it really important for people to share their work, their creative work? I think so. Because in that exposition there is a shift, there is a change. There is an aspect of evolution. Of becoming someone different, because of being able to trust enough in what was created.\n\nAgain I’m falling in the trap of separation, because I’m talking about ‘they’. I’m also the same. I haven’t been able to consistently share what I write about, and I’m just stuck in my own void here. I do it for myself, and I’m not open to sharing it with the world. What needs to happen for me to do it? That is the interesting aspect of all of this. As I open up to write, I realize those aspets of myself that have not been integrated yet, and I open up the door for that integration. What can happen if I open up and share my work? What is the consequence of that? There will be a rejection from some part of society, for those that are not open to what I have to say. Is it that hard though? Is it that bad? Of course not. It has never been this easy to be rejected. What needs to happen for us to change the perspective from all the critics? There can be 100 comments below a picture, and we tend to stay with the one that is the harsh one. We filter all the other 99 that are supporting us and we stay with the one that pushes us down. What is this teaching me about myself? About the relationship that I have with myself?\n\nWhat if I start giving a fuck about that critic?\nWhat if I truly don’t care about it, or just integrate it as a piece of information that is equally valuable than all the other ones?\n\nThat is what needs to start happening. A transformation. An opening. To the world. To the critics. To everything that happens when I’m able to share everything of what I am, without the boundaries that the mind builds as the means for preventing that to happen.\n",

What is the consequence of that? There will be a rejection from some part of society, for those that are not open to what I have to say. Is it that hard though? Is it that bad? Of course not.

          "raw": "\nWhat is the aspect of ourselves that prevents us from sitting down and Doing The Work? How can the balance be reached? Which is the point on which the patterns of behavior that bring me away from it are made conscious so that they can be changed? Which is the difference between excuses and stuff that is necessary to go through to actually evolve?\n\nRight now I have the willingness to write kind of blaming myself for going into pattenrs of action that I know are not good for me, but I keep doing them, blaming others. Or using them as an excuse to do what I do. I smoke weed so that I can have a good time with my wife and her friend. Is that truly necessary? Is anyone forcing me to do it? But I keep going into that, falling into that victim mentality of thinking that there is someone forcing me to do stuff. And no one is doing that, I am the own master of my own life, I am the one that needs to take it into account, and I have to start putting on the pants so that I can become self-sovereign.\n\nI ate all that sugar to feel how I feel, to be the witness of what it brings to my experience, and it is ok like that. Now I am witnessing, and what it brings are these feelings of not being good enough, which are always present as a way of blaming myself. And I know that I am not this feelings, and if that I want to truly know myself and know who I am there needs to be a recognition about this, about the aspects of myself that make me feel in a particular way, and actually about the aspects of myself that feel the way they feel. And also showing up now to write is a major information source, because of how I feel as I write.\n\nThe other days when I have came to write there has been like a sense of freedom, of flow, which is not present in this moment. If I had to describe how I feel now, there is something kind of sluggish present. Like a mass of starch with water that is trying to move towards somewhere and doesn’t truly know how to move, how to make that progress.\n\nWhat comes is that difference between expectation (‘where I should be’) and the acknowledgment of where I am at, that always induces in me this sense of anxiety of wanting to be in another place. That is always part of my experience, and as I move towards a dissolving of this expectation I realize that I’m making some kind of progress, in this line of action that there is no progress really because everything happens at the same time. Everything is perfect as it is right now. It has always been. It is only in me to be able to witness that from the perspective of truth, of realizing that actually it is that way. What a crazy thing. That every master throughout history (or the story) has known this as the biggest truth of them all, and how hard it is to actually experience life from that standpoint.\n\nThis existence is like the eternal story. The never ending story. Life is a never ending story. Going round and round in this cycle of shifting emotions, circumstances, people and energy. Nothing that I write truly makes sense, and there is a big aspect of myself that is judging this moment as a waste of time. As if there was something more important to be done in this moment. Being with my daughter, with my partner. But where are the limits. I also need to make progress in this exploration of what the writing will bring. When do I give myself to put down into the paper my thoughts and emotions so that I can afterwards come for them and realize how I was feeling this Sunday morning listening to the birds outside, food hangovered and feeling bad because it is too late for me to being doing this, I should have woke up earlier so that I could do all my stuff before the girls waking up so that I could feel amazing today, with my heart full of joy of having put inside a new day of bringing into the world what I want to bring.\n\nWhat is it that I want to bring? That is the best question to ask. Because it has evolved so much throughout my experience as a human being, going from one place to another one, experimenting life and its different aspects like a pendulum, which goes from one extreme to the next one. I’m not able to bring balance into my life, because I always oscilate between extremes. How can this be resolved? How can I reconcile these extremes and integrate them into a balanced experienced of what it means to be alive for me?\n\nHow can I summarize what I want to bring to the world? Nothing special. Just myself. Just my translation of the life force that is moving through me, so that I can create from there. I failed. But to who I failed? Is it just inside me? Do other people see me as a failure? I don’t think so. Yesterday I spent a long time talking to and old friend, and it was an amazing talk. Do I think that he sees me as a failure? I don’t think so. We enjoyed it. No one is going to come and get me by the hand and tell me hey, you are not a failure. Nope, not at all. No one is going to do that. It is my duty to be in charge of that. I am the one that needs to show up for myself, and start sharing everything of what I am so that I can bring more of that.\n\nWhat do I want to bring into the world?\n\nMore of what I am. More of every piece, every moment of what I am. And in this moment, I am a constant blaming of not having done things ‘as they should have been done’. I am writing a book that is called ‘The End Of Shoulds’, and here I am, shouldding myself. How original this is. How fun it must be to witness the intricacies of this crazy mind running around in circles, trying to catch its tail. Running round and round and round, feeling what it feels to be alive through the words that come. Through the blaming. You shouldn’t have done that. But I did it with an intention. I ate all that yesterday with the intention to share with my girls. I ate all those cereals in the morning with the intention of feeling how it felt in my body. I ate breakfast with the girls with the intention of sharing that space with them. When is the moment on which I acknowledge that intention, and start accepting it as an integral part of my reality in this moment?\n\nI did it with intention, and now that intention is forgotten. What if I go back into the consequences of what my intention had in the world?\n\nIt was amazing to deepen my relationship with my wife and her friend yesterday. Smoking that joint helped me feel how it feels to not have tension inside the brain. It was a relief of that tension. I know that I have to work my way through it on my own, but what if I need a little bit of help? When there is an aspect of myself that feels that there needs to be a breakthrough soon, if not the world is doomed, it is that part of me that feels that things should be different than what they are. And that is the part that I’m recognizing as the one that I’m not, so this what I’m writing about here is actually the information that I need to make some progress. I feel bad after having done something with intention because that which I did is not aligned with what I should do. I should not eat in the night. I should wake up early and write so that I’m ready early in the morning. I should do this. I should do that. The book should be called the eternal shoulds. Yes. That makes a little bit more of sense. Should here, should there. All running around from one should to the other one. What if I brought shoulds into the normal world, into the day to day world? Maybe that is my mission here, to be able to should from the morning to the night, bridging the gap from what should be to what is. That is the gap that I’m bridging every day. The one from what should be to the one that is.\n\nI wrote the other day about bringing the teachings to the normal random person, and perharps that is my mission here. How can I bring the end of shoulds into a normal person? Probably by embodying it. If I think about how to do it, it is a process that comes from the mind, from wanting to know. The mind wants to know, the body wants to feel comfort. That is what my mind is trying to do. To know the answer. What should be done in order to bridge that gap. That is the mind doing its thing. And this game is played in another realm. The one of just doing. Of meeting people, and opening up the space for a transformation to happen. The end of shoulds starts from a place that is different from the mind. From an interface that is different. I’m doing my thing from that place also, it is the one that is the most comfortable for me. How to get out from there and just start to enjoy life? That is the mission that comes. That is the space that I need to start holding. For people to open up. Not the biggest entrepreneurs of the world, not the most important people of them all, but just the normal and random dudes that go from a to b in a way that is automatic, because life does not have anything better from them. Those are the ones that I need to talk to, to bridge this gap, to better understand my role in this whole thing. Maybe more than understand it, just to live it in a way that is nice.\n\nGente del sur. That is the podcast that I should start. Really, I should have 6 different podcasts, one for each day of the week. Gente del sur, Timeless Integration, Into Tech, Towards the Metaverse, The New Medicine, The New Religion. Those are all topics that I am very interested about, and I should have a podcast in each one of them so that I can grow through having conversations with people from all over the world around those topics. Yes, this is a new aspect of myself running around in circles, battling against my own mind as I find ways of relating in a different way to what I want to bring into the world. A radio. That is what I have always wanted to bring into the world. A radio. One that is present in every city, in every small city in every part of the world, and which is able to bring into the people of that part joy. That is the mission of the radio, to shine a light into the amazing individuals of that particular place, and help them live a life that is fulfilling. Maybe that is my life’s mission. To create a radio. That is what my family has been pushing me towards, with my granparents listning to a lot of music, and my grandfather having a music store. How would my life look like if I had a radio? What do you do for a living? I have a radio. And I create the programming of it, so that people can enjoy it in every moment. What is the name of the radio? It is not clear now. But it is the dream of the eternal festival. Music being played 24/7, with the clear intention of shining a light into the particular aspects that every human being brings into life. Yes. A radio brings a lot of what I care about together. The joy of life. The joy of what every human being is. Historically there has been a local radio in each part of the world, and through this, we can be able to travel back in time and join the technology of the old world with the one of the new one.\n\nHow does a modern radio look like? How do you tune into it? Is it an app? The Human Music App. That is something that a lot of people have asked me for. Make it an app. That is your mission, to make it as an app. And people can go in and do their thing. Listen and give their time to listen to what is going on in there, without recordings, only with what is present. You can’t go back, you can just witness what is present. How many channels would a radio that has one channel for every municipality in the world have? That is the smallest unit of connection between human beings IRL, the municipalities. That is how they come together and organize themselves. How does a new municipality look like? What if Puerto Varas was the first one in the world that implemented its own token? That is something important that I listened yesterday in that web3 talk, how DAO’s can be the means by which IRL businesses come together to do similar things. The interesting about the world how it works now is that there is X amount of small businesses that work in a particular way throughout the world. What if just one of them, in each place of the world, transformed the way on which it did its thing so that people could come to do something different? My heart always comes back to what I have been designing this whole time, the infinite jest, human music. The downtown cinema. David Foster Wallace is always there, in the background, calling me from its place wherever he is. He is calling my attention and letting me know: The only book that you need to read is The Infinite Jest. That is the one that you have to study, over and over again. The answers to depression are in there. You can jump from one to the next one all your life, but the important thing that you need to know is in only that book. Each book points toward the same thing. Know yourself. Know who you are, and from there, act into the world with that knowing. With that truth. I can spend my whole life gathering inspiration from other books, but the biggest inspiration of them all that I can get is by having conversations with people from different parts. What am I interested in? Science, spirit, health, music, normal people, web3, software engineering. These are all topics that I care about, and by bringing in people to talk about them I can make progress in it. The thing is that I can have a never ending list of things that I care about, but the integral one of them all is that I care about human nature. That is the common ground of them all. Human Nature. What if I call it human nature? The Human Nature Podcast. One episode in English, one in Spanish. I can run around with that show every day, to the rest of my life. And how could I do something more important than exploring life from the eyes of a different person, each day, forever and ever? Give myself time to explore that person and realize how amazing it is to be alive from that exploration.\n\nPerharps that is what I have to do. Enjoy life by seeing myself in the eyes of another person. Yes. That sounds like a good thing to do. And use music as the means of that exploration. The album that they will bring to the other side is the best way on which I can do that. Explore it. If you died tomorrow, what album would you bring to the other side? Yes. Without the fluff of wanting to put inside their mouth religion, science, or whatever. Just with the willingness to explore who they are by interacting with them from the heart. That is all what is needed. Lex Fridman publishes an episode almost every three days. Is there someone that listens to all of them? Probably not. The important thing is not that. The important thing is that they happen. That they exist. That is all that matters. Because in that exploration is the magic. In the exploration of what it means to be alive. Maybe the only person that will listen to the podcast will be the mother of my guest. It doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is how much I will learn by interacting with that person. I am a chameleon, and I can go into the story of whatever person I want, with all of who I am. I can bring them in, and have a joyful conversation with them. That is the exploration. That is what my heart tells me to bring into the world. It is not that pure complexity of trying to go into the depth of life by going deep and deep. Seeking and seeking. It is about realizing that I am every one of these human beings, and in that exploration, I become alive. I discover who I am by interacting with people like you. That is the magic. To just open myself to that discovery, by opening myself to have those conversations. Open myself to share what I am with the world, and learn from there. Things will happen. Things will come to being. The only thing that matters is that is happens. Through me. Through my willingness to explore. To discover. To face the void.\n\nI came here and wrote about things not being the way they should be, because I did not do them properly. The trap inside any routine that you can force yourself into is that you can start identifying with it. ‘I can only be creative if I do it in the morning after having fasted for 15 hours’. That is a container for creativity, but the best can come when you least expect it. Transform your relationship with yourself, so that you can live 24/7 in presence, being a permanent channel for life force to come into the material world through you. Every aspect of yourself is that creative force, not only the one that is present before the sun comes up.\n\nThat is the consequence of having showed up today to write this. I started with a feeling of this moment not being a good one, because I was not in the best mood, but what came up is perfect as it is. It is the information that needed to come. That is the game that we need to learn how to play, each one of us. Create the boundaries for that to happen in your own life. You don’t need to block 7 hours. You just need a small space so that you can tap into yourself and create from there. The spark of light is waiting for you to ignite it, and the aspect of yourself that thinks than that can only happen in a particular moment of the day is your ego. Become free of that.\n",

Really, I should have 6 different podcasts, one for each day of the week. Gente del sur, Timeless Integration, Into Tech, Towards the Metaverse, The New Medicine, The New Religion. Those are all topics that I am very interested about, and I should have a podcast in each one of them so that I can grow through having conversations with people from all over the world around those topics. Yes, this is a new aspect of myself running around in circles, battling against my own mind as I find ways of relating in a different way to what I want to bring into the world. A radio. That is what I have always wanted to bring into the world. A radio. One that is present in every city, in every small city in every part of the world, and which is able to bring into the people of that part joy. That is the mission of the radio, to shine a light into the amazing individuals of that particular place, and help them live a life that is fulfilling. Maybe that is my life\\u2019s mission. To create a radio. That is what my family has been pushing me towards, with my granparents listning to a lot of music, and my grandfather having a music store. How would my life look like if I had a radio? What do you do for a living? I have a radio. And I create the programming of it, so that people can enjoy it in every moment. What is the name of the radio? It is not clear now. But it is the dream of the eternal festival. Music being played 24/7, with the clear intention of shining a light into the particular aspects that every human being brings into life. Yes. A radio brings a lot of what I care about together. The joy of life. The joy of what every human being is. Historically there has been a local radio in each part of the world, and through this, we can be able to travel back in time and join the technology of the old world with the one of the new one.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"How does a modern radio look like? How do you tune into it? Is it an app? The Human Music App. That is something that a lot of people have asked me for. Make it an app. That is your mission, to make it as an app. And people can go in and do their thing. Listen and give their time to listen to what is going on in there, without recordings, only with what is present. You can\\u2019t go back, you can just witness what is present. How many channels would a radio that has one channel for every municipality in the world have? That is the smallest unit of connection between human beings IRL, the municipalities. That is how they come together and organize themselves. How does a new municipality look like? What if Puerto Varas was the first one in the world that implemented its own token? That is something important that I listened yesterday in that web3 talk, how DAO\\u2019s can be the means by which IRL businesses come together to do similar things. The interesting about the world how it works now is that there is X amount of small businesses that work in a particular way throughout the world. What if just one of them, in each place of the world, transformed the way on which it did its thing so that people could come to do something different? My heart always comes back to what I have been designing this whole time, the infinite jest, human music. The downtown cinema. David Foster Wallace is always there, in the background, calling me from its place wherever he is. He is calling my attention and letting me know: The only book that you need to read is The Infinite Jest. That is the one that you have to study, over and over again. The answers to depression are in there. You can jump from one to the next one all your life, but the important thing that you need to know is in only that book. Each book points toward the same thing. Know yourself. Know who you are, and from there, act into the world with that knowing. With that truth. I can spend my whole life gathering inspiration from other books, but the biggest inspiration of them all that I can get is by having conversations with people from different parts. What am I interested in? Science, spirit, health, music, normal people, web3, software engineering. These are all topics that I care about, and by bringing in people to talk about them I can make progress in it. The thing is that I can have a never ending list of things that I care about, but the integral one of them all is that I care about human nature. That is the common ground of them all. Human Nature. What if I call it human nature? The Human Nature Podcast. One episode in English, one in Spanish. I can run around with that show every day, to the rest of my life. And how could I do something more important than exploring life from the eyes of a different person, each day, forever and ever? Give myself time to explore that person and realize how amazing it is to be alive from that exploration.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Perharps that is what I have to do. Enjoy life by seeing myself in the eyes of another person. Yes. That sounds like a good thing to do. And use music as the means of that exploration. The album that they will bring to the other side is the best way on which I can do that. Explore it. If you died tomorrow, what album would you bring to the other side? Yes. Without the fluff of wanting to put inside their mouth religion, science, or whatever. Just with the willingness to explore who they are by interacting with them from the heart. That is all what is needed. Lex Fridman publishes an episode almost every three days. Is there someone that listens to all of them? Probably not. The important thing is not that. The important thing is that they happen. That they exist. That is all that matters. Because in that exploration is the magic. In the exploration of what it means to be alive. Maybe the only person that will listen to the podcast will be the mother of my guest. It doesn\\u2019t matter. The only thing that matters is how much I will learn by interacting with that person. I am a chameleon, and I can go into the story of whatever person I want, with all of who I am. I can bring them in, and have a joyful conversation with them. That is the exploration. That is what my heart tells me to bring into the world. It is not that pure complexity of trying to go into the depth of life by going deep and deep. Seeking and seeking. It is about realizing that I am every one of these human beings, and in that exploration, I become alive. I discover who I am by interacting with people like you. That is the magic. To just open myself to that discovery, by opening myself to have those conversations. Open myself to share what I am with the world, and learn from there. Things will happen. Things will come to being. The only thing that matters is that is happens. Through me. Through my willingness to explore. To discover.

That is a container for creativity, but the best can come when you least expect it.

          "raw": "\nWhat’s up with my capacity for being consistent? Is this even working? I keep running in circles, not truly knowing where I’m heading to. Into the depth of my own heart, that’s what I’m told, but how will I be able to translate that into something actionable in the world? Which are the steps that I’m going to take so that I can make the progress that I want to make? And what is progress? I’m already where I will always be, it is just an illusion. What wants to be expressed is my capacity for building up cool stuff, for showing up and creating from there. And music is the biggest aspect of what I am that wants to be shown through me. But how am I going to monetize that? Where am I heading to? Which are the aspects of myself that want to help other people, and what do I want to help them in?\n\nA big part of me was thinking today about alcohol. That has been such a big aspect of my life, my relationship to alcohol. I was drunk all the weekend for a big part of my life, as I went to university, as I had so much fun. But I was living a life that was not helping me reach my potential, because of all that numbing that came through that alcohol intake.\n\nIf you died tomorrow, what album would you take to the other side? That is the big question that my heart asks. My heart wants connection with other human beings. It wants to be there from them. My heart wants that radio to exist, and have different channels inside it so that people can do their work with it on the background. I love curating content, it is part of what I came here to do, and it is my mission to be able to curate that so I can bring it on. That is what I need to bring. Dimension JP. That is the podcast name that comes to mind now. Bringing people in there and starting from that point. If you died tomorrow, what album would you take to the other side? And research the person. And help her go deep and deep into their experience as a human being, so that from there we can hold the space for each other’s transformation. What if I was there for each of them, all the time? What if that is what needs to happen? And all the complexity that I’m building around the project is just noise, because what is important is the connection with the human being that is behind that complexity, and there is no better means for fostering that connection than a 1:1 conversation. I have always searched that connection, and in the masses it gets lost. I don’t like it that way. I just like it to be deep, meaningful, and complete. No less, no more. It is just what it is. Area JP. That is a name that calls my attention, because it is the same in English and in Spanish. Time to go back in time and search for the conversations that I have already had with people in the podcast. What did they bring to me? And not only in the podcast, in every podcast that I have done. With all of them. Into Tech, Timeless Integration, etc. They all brought something special to me, and to the interaction with that person. That was very valuable, and it is important for me to walk the road of understanding that each human being has something to add to the world, and that in that I can make progress in the understanding of myself through the eyes of them. I become more of who I am by interacting with people like you. With normal human beings like you. That is the power of this thing, and I keep running in circles related to that because there is magic in it. There is magic on having a public conversation. There is value in holding space for the transformation of the other person by opening up the door for this conversation to happen. I keep running in circles with this one, because there is something that has wanted to come out for a long time.\n\nAnd writing here is how I clarify what I have inside. What is it that I have inside? What is it that wants to be expressed through my interaction with the world? What is it that wants to be brought up? Less noise, more clarity. I just want to bring more clarity, and it is very hard for me to do it. I just keep running in circles. What is it that I’m bringing? Who am I helping? Who do I want to become? I speak about alcohol, and presence, and stuff, but what is it really what I want to bring? What is it that my heart is craving for? In a 1:1 conversation with another human being there is nothing like time present, because you can’t fast forward it. If you are reading, or listening to a podcast, or whatever, you can do those things. You can skip. But if you want to learn how to listen, you’ve got to listen. And what better way of doing it than just by listening? Holding space for that conversation to happen, for it to be available to the world. Jordan Bates wrote that speech is the highest form of hypnosiss, and there is something in me related to that. There is something hypnotic about golding space for the transformation of another human being. What if I open that door and let me be transformed by holding the space for that person? Sharing an hour long meditation won’t help too much, but what if I hold the space for that person to just talk? What does come from there? Holy shit, these last days my writing has been just noise. I feel out of focus. How is this connected to Dukkha? What is dukkha anyways?\n\nWhich was the main intention behind it? I’m building from a place of ego, of wanting to bring something that doesn’t exist. But will someone follow me? I’m not sure. What if the chameleon is expressed through different topics? I can talk to guests one month related to building an audience in twitter, and how that is connected to personal growth. The next month I can talk to people from the web3 space, and create from there. Yes, I need to focus on cycles of talking to people with a certain frame of action, so that I can better reach them out. When I did Into Tech, the goal of the conversation was clear, and that brought a lot into the conversation itself. What if I talk about social media as a means of spiritual evolution? How can I frame that in a way that is helpful?\n\nWhat if I talk about the impact that Twitter has in the life of people? I keep extrapolating into other forms of social media, but that is still adding to the noise. Why do I want to bring in that noise? Is it necessary? I don’t think so. What is necessary is for me to be able to filter that noise, so that people can get to know me for what I am. Beyond the words. I have been using a very complicated language, which brings me away from people. Which isolates me from the 90% of the people. And I’m attached to those that have been listening to me, responding to what I share. I’m stuck thinking that they are the ones that are going to drive my value up, when it is not like that. What is going to happen is that I will grow with people different from them, and I’m going to be able to spread my word with them. Will I change in that process? I don’t think so. I can’t change. What can change, or evolve, is the relationship that I have to myself. It is the relationship that I have been building with my own capacity to create. I have created a lot of stuff, and it is in there, present, waiting for me to realize which is the way on which every part of it will make sense. This is the sense making machine. Me trying to make sense of everything that is inside me so that I can act from there. Every day. Moving towards a way of being. A way of embodying more and more of what I am. Is it necessary to get into the complexities of a new technology? I don’t think so, because the major technology of them all is being able to make people trust you. And how do you build trust? By showing up. How can I make people trust me? By Doing The Work. By showing up. It is time to show up. But what if I start showing up and it doesn’t happen anymore? What do people really need from me?\n\nWhere do I want to go? What are the steps that are going to take me there? Who have I been? Who am I going to take to the ride? These are all interesting and valid questions, because they speak about the person that I am, and who I want to become through my own actions. What do I want to do? I want to be able to create. Just create for the sake of it. Build stuff. On the realm that I decide. With the platforms that I decide. May it be program A or B, it doesn’t matter. What matters is that I build, and that I bring all of my capacity into it. 4 hours of dedicated work, of putting in the work, is all that it takes. It doesn’t matter if it is writing, or building a 3d model, or creating music, or whatever. It just matters that it is a creative endeavor. That is the goal. To learn how to learn. Which is the thing that I’m going to create next? How will it fit with the overall hierarchy of stuff? Where am I heading to? How do I see myself?\n\nI want to help people heal. That is the main goal of my life. I want to heal myself, so that I can express all of what I am through the creative act. I want to lose myself in the creative act. Become it. Live through it. And do something valuable from there. Me coming here to write is an expression of that, of what I want to become, because writing is the means by which I have found that I can better discover who I am. But writing to who? What if I spent all my day writing towards other people? What if every piece of writing that I created was with the intention of connecting with who the other person is? What is I truly cared about that person and went deep into that connection by establishing it deeply? Perharps that is a mission that I have for now, being able to connect with the other person and build from there.\n\nThe other day I messaged Ryan Breslow and told him that I want to write a book about him. I want to be able to translate his whole story into something that is a consequence of who he is. That every part of my creative endeavor will be just throwing out something as a consequence of what I experience from him. Translate what I am into something that can summarize who he is. That is something new that takes place inside me as an exploration. Another exploration. Holy shit, all this thing is just one exploration after the other one. But the thing is that I need to start adding value to other people in the sense of helping them with a particular problem, so that they can reward me economically and with that I can continue to do it over and over.\n\nThe infinite jest is the book that defined me. Which are the main topics of it? Addiction, depression, and entertainment. What if I set those as the goals for my life’s work? The most important mission of my life is to help you deal with those three aspect. How to find a healthy balance? How to integrate all of your life experience into who you are right now so that you can have a healthy relationship with those three things? You have certain wounds in your emotional body that make you think that you are addicted, that there is no way out of it. What if the way out of it was through? What if you could develop a healthy relationship with every aspect of your being that is attached to these particular elements of life? They won’t go away.\n\nI used to be the best drinker that I knew. I had a deep relationship with alcohol. And how I can drink and stop. It doesn’t define who I am by any means, I can control it because I have done the work of better understanding which is the role that alcohol has played in my life. It has been helpful, and it played its role. But my mission is to be the witness of that role, understanding it, and integrate it. It doesn’t define who I am, by any means. Is this where I’m walking towards?\n\nI don’t know. I said that I’m building a DAO to transform life into the intersection of a meditation retreat and a festival, but am I really doing that? I’m not even able to do that in my own life, am I truly capable of holding the space for other people to do it? I don’t think so. But how can I know if I don’t do it? I’m finding the way on which the message can be spread more clearly. Which is this way? Is it truly through what I have been doing? People talk about meditating like a monk, and then I talk to them and they say that they meditate just 5 minutes in the morning and 5 minutes in the night. What the fuck is that. 5 minutes! That speaks to me about the amount of BS that is present in social media, because people talk but don’t walk the path. They don’t sit. But I do sit. I do care. Which is the moment on which I embrace this and start realizing that what I have for offer is valuable, because there is in me the power of being consistent and putting in the effort that transforms lifes?\n\nIs it truly valuable to sit down and meditate through the album of the day? Is this something that adds value to the world or it is just my ego trying to do its thing? Where is the boundary between what is helpful for the world and what my ego builds as helpful? That is a major trick of this whole thing. The ego building up ideas of how to help, but help itself. The fact that people meditate only 5 minutes speaks to me about how shallow their practice is. What if I just go into social media to practice a mindful social media meditation for 5 minutes? How will that change the way on which people perceive their interaction with the whole platform? I can be the means by which they stop. I can be the present that they give to themselves so that they can truly develop a healthy relationship with the scrolling. Why are they scrolling? How long have they being doing it? Social media as a spiritual practice starts with the acknowledgment of the addiction. It starts with the understanding of what it brought to you. It is the most important thing of our time. What if we start developing a healthy relationship to it? I will teach you how to use social media in your own benefit. To be a master of it. That is the thing. Be a master of social media. It is the stuff on which most of humanity spends most of their time. It is time to do it right. No one taught us how. The only way in is through.\n\nIt is time to awaken from the dream. I’m building up my presence, and the one thing that has been revolving the most inside me is this social media as a spiritual practice thing. How to achieve that presence? How to nurture instead of drain? How to make a good use of your time? How to be present with every feeling that is inside you as you go through your timeline? What does that teach you about yourself? How can that enhance your whole life? How can you get out of that trap? People spend countless hours on these things. It is time to get out of there. It is time to start being mindful about your presence. Social media is for sharing your creativity, for connecting with other people, to build up your interests. Be active with it. Be intentional. Which the intention with which I’m going to go into this platform right now? What is it that I want to get out of it?\n\nEach post that I share, each comment that I write can be the means by which I deepen my relationship with the world, and with myself. This whole thing is about leaving the passivity behind, and realizing that each person can use SM as the means of spiritual evolution. Self actualization by discovering how you decide to interact with the world. By better understanding of what do you bring to it, and how do you frame yourself in that understanding. That is the magic. That is the pure magic of this whole thing. Learn how to be a creator. Learn how to manifest your joy. Learn how to develop a deeper relationship with all of what you are by opening up that creative avenue that has been closed all this time. I’m here to help you on that path. I’m here to bring about the best of you. And that starts by realizing why do you consume the content that you consume. Which is the value that it brings into the world? Into your world?\n\nDukkha is about the end of depression, and what drives depression right now is the lack of meaning. It is the end of depression by opening up all of those creative avenues that we have inside and have been shut down by this modern society. It is about opening that window, and realizing the value that is inside each one of those aspects. NFTs are the way to go, because they represent a digital creation. The people that I follow and that I admire are just talking about creation, about building, about manifesting into this reality what you know is true. What your own truth is. It doesn’t matter if it is A or B. It just matters that it is. The first transformational journey of Dukkha will be related to cinema4d, and we will explore what creativity means from there. It is time for me to open up that door, and invite people that want to enjoy the ride. My style is to put in the work, to create in a consistent way by establishing routines. But this doesn’t mean that for other people it is the same. Respect that, and realize which is the fundamental aspect of what I want to build. A community of people that want to help each other. That’s all. And twitter spaces is the thing. It is where the stuff is happening, and where the magic goes. Let the magic flow. We came here for that. Create, build, and they will come.\n",

I speak about alcohol, and presence, and stuff, but what is it really what I want to bring? What is it that my heart is craving for? In a 1:1 conversation with another human being there is nothing like time present, because you can\\u2019t fast forward it. If you are reading, or listening to a podcast, or whatever, you can do those things. You can skip. But if you want to learn how to listen, you\\u2019ve got to listen. And what better way of doing it than just by listening? Holding space for that conversation to happen, for it to be available to the world. Jordan Bates wrote that speech is the highest form of hypnosiss, and there is something in me related to that. There is something hypnotic about golding space for the transformation of another human being. What if I open that door and let me be transformed by holding the space for that person? Sharing an hour long meditation won\\u2019t help too much, but what if I hold the space for that person to just talk? What does come from there? Holy shit, these last days my writing has been just noise. I feel out of focus. How is this connected to Dukkha? What is dukkha anyways?\"}),`\n`,(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:\"Which was the main intention behind it? I\\u2019m building from a place of ego, of wanting to bring something that doesn\\u2019t exist. But will someone follow me? I\\u2019m not sure. What if the chameleon is expressed through different topics? I can talk to guests one month related to building an audience in twitter, and how that is connected to personal growth. The next month I can talk to people from the web3 space, and create from there. Yes, I need to focus on cycles of talking to people with a certain frame of action, so that I can better reach them out. When I did Into Tech, the goal of the conversation was clear, and that brought a lot into the conversation itself. What if I talk about social media as a means of spiritual evolution? How can I frame that in a way that is helpful?\"}),`\n`,(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:\"What if I talk about the impact that Twitter has in the life of people? I keep extrapolating into other forms of social media, but that is still adding to the noise. Why do I want to bring in that noise? Is it necessary? I don\\u2019t think so. What is necessary is for me to be able to filter that noise, so that people can get to know me for what I am. Beyond the words. I have been using a very complicated language, which brings me away from people. Which isolates me from the 90% of the people. And I\\u2019m attached to those that have been listening to me, responding to what I share. I\\u2019m stuck thinking that they are the ones that are going to drive my value up, when it is not like that. What is going to happen is that I will grow with people different from them, and I\\u2019m going to be able to spread my word with them. Will I change in that process? I don\\u2019t think so. I can\\u2019t change. What can change, or evolve, is the relationship that I have to myself. It is the relationship that I have been building with my own capacity to create. I have created a lot of stuff, and it is in there, present, waiting for me to realize which is the way on which every part of it will make sense. This is the sense making machine. Me trying to make sense of everything that is inside me so that I can act from there. Every day. Moving towards a way of being. A way of embodying more and more of what I am. Is it necessary to get into the complexities of a new technology? I don\\u2019t think so, because the major technology of them all is being able to make people trust you. And how do you build trust? By showing up. How can I make people trust me? By Doing The Work. By showing up. It is time to show up. But what if I start showing up and it doesn\\u2019t happen anymore?

Just create for the sake of it. Build stuff. On the realm that I decide. With the platforms that I decide. May it be program A or B, it doesn\\u2019t matter. What matters is that I build, and that I bring all of my capacity into it. 4 hours of dedicated work, of putting in the work, is all that it takes. It doesn\\u2019t matter if it is writing, or building a 3d model, or creating music, or whatever. It just matters that it is a creative endeavor. That is the goal. To learn how to learn.

Me coming here to write is an expression of that, of what I want to become, because writing is the means by which I have found that I can better discover who I am. But writing to who? What if I spent all my day writing towards other people? What if every piece of writing that I created was with the intention of connecting with who the other person is?

That is something new that takes place inside me as an exploration. Another exploration. Holy shit, all this thing is just one exploration after the other one.

I\\u2019m finding the way on which the message can be spread more clearly. Which is this way? Is it truly through what I have been doing? People talk about meditating like a monk, and then I talk to them and they say that they meditate just 5 minutes in the morning and 5 minutes in the night. What the fuck is that. 5 minutes! That speaks to me about the amount of BS that is present in social media, because people talk but don\\u2019t walk the path. They don\\u2019t sit. But I do sit. I do care.

What if I just go into social media to practice a mindful social media meditation for 5 minutes? How will that change the way on which people perceive their interaction with the whole platform? I can be the means by which they stop. I can be the present that they give to themselves so that they can truly develop a healthy relationship with the scrolling. Why are they scrolling? How long have they being doing it? Social media as a spiritual practice starts with the acknowledgment of the addiction. It starts with the understanding of what it brought to you. It is the most important thing of our time. What if we start developing a healthy relationship to it? I will teach you how to use social media in your own benefit. To be a master of it.

How can that enhance your whole life? How can you get out of that trap? People spend countless hours on these things. It is time to get out of there.

          "raw": "\nWhat is present in me today is the willingness to talk about the reasons of why I’m doing what I’m doing. What is behind this project. Which are the motivations that make me want to transform it into a reality. As I write, what comes up is the importance to recognize also what this project aims to bring into the world. How is it going to be different from what it is now from what is being built through these words? Who are the persons that I see being part of this, and how are they going to be transformed because of this whole thing? This are all questions that come to mind right now, and as I write that they come to mind I think: Are they truly coming to mind or are they just begin written? Because I’m not truly thinking about them, they are just happening. I’m just being through this words. Wasn’t that what I wanted? Wasn’t that what this whole game was about? Realizing my true nature so that I could be more present in all of my actions? I’m here, present, traveling through this moment as each stroke of the keys of this computer writes a new word. Everything that is happening right now is an exploration into everything that is, through each of these letters. Welcome to my mind. Welcome to my being. This is all of who I am. And I’m also you. It is time to recognize that.\n\nThe first word that comes to mind is community. The last two years have been for me about doing the work, showing up, but it has always been for myself, by myself, very isolated. In my own room, waking up early, and showing up. Not being able to share with too many people what is going on, because of the lack of people in my network which are going through a process like mine. I guess that there is actually no one in my network that is going through this. And it feels very lonely. And I feel that I always have to find out energy somewhere so that I can keep doing it. I have been able to do that, I have been able to keep showing up by recognizing the importance of doing it, but I also recognize that if I would have been able to do it in a different way it probably would have been more efficient. There is an amazing power on community, on being able to express, to bring out what is inside, and that is what I want to foster, to share, with this whole thing. There is a deep need for people to connect, to share with others that are on the same step of their path, or not in the same step, but at least traveling the same path. This gives energy to the whole process, and there is a feeling inside me that it makes awareness feel less alone. More complete. Energized. There is an aspect of being in community that is very important for this whole process, and in my experience there is a lack of that in this moment in the world. There are people that are doing their thing, helping as much as they can, but I feel it is not enough. Something bigger needs to happen, more energy needs to be focused, and Dukkha will be about that. It will be about tending hands, and being accountable to each other. Helping each other realize that they are not alone in their journey, and having someone to count on. To feel comfortable with. Someone that will want to help them get to where they want to get. I know that awakening is not about going somewhere, it is about discovering the truth of what has always been here, and always will, but you get the point… There is a path that needs to be walked, and this community, this energy, will be the concentration of those paths. It will be a vortex of energy of those who want to awake. And that is powerful in and of itself. The challenge is to create the means for that to happen, but there has not been a better moment for it than today. The internet and its tools are exploding. It is time. We are ready. The technology is getting there. As I have written in other places, blockchain will help its get rid of the samsara’s of society that won’t let energy flow freely, and with that, comes a new stage in human evolution. The truth will come forth, as more and more people open up themselves to being true, to being what they have always have been. Without filters, without second interpretations. We will be there for all of those who want to be truth. For all of those who want to live from that truth.\n\nThat is what awakening is about. Opening yourself to the possibility of living life from your own truth, whatever it is. Being able to see what is going on without the filters of what should be. Opening to what is. And navigating this whole adventure from there. If you want to be part of Dukkha, that is the game for which you are signing up. The game of facing the truth, the game of making the hard decisions. This whole process will show you some uncomfortable stuff, really uncomfortable stuff, but by being there for each other we can navigate it together. All the doors will be open, and all will come out. Are you ready for facing that? I’m sure you aren’t. No one is. That’s why we’ve got to become no one. Each one of us needs to become no one. That’s the game.\n\nThat leads me to the next one. This place also exists as an exploration into the unknown. Into what can happen when you let energy move freely throughout a particular system. Dukkha will be an open vortex of energy, that will be transformed by the input of each one of the persons that decide to be part of it. That give part of their life force to the pursuit of its mission. What I’m doing here, with this words, is establishing the first way on which this movement of energy will flow, but no one know what it will look like in the future. That is where the unknown lies. In that not knowing, there is a huge space for exploration. Into what can be. With the input of each one of us. Marveling together by what this will become. There is a lot of beauty in the unknown, when you start realizing that each moment is Ann opportunity to get a stronger grasp of that fact. I don’t even know what the next phrase will look like, what it will say. Every word that I write is an exploration into the present, by sharing what shows up, by sharing what comes up. Opening myself to this is helpful, is a miracle, and it is acknowledging the unknown in every second. If I came here and started ‘should-ing’ about which words should be written, this whole unknown-bigness aspect would become kind of conflicted. And Idon’t want that, I want this to be as sincere as possible, as pure as possible, so that it can convey a message that talks to your soul. Not to who you think you are, but to who you truly are. There is an intention of communicating from soul to soul here. Open up to what that communication is trying to say, because it will bring about stuff inside you that you don’t even know exists. It is a miracle. It is the miracle of the present moment, it is the miracle of the exploration into the present moment. Into everything that is. Everything that has bee is already here, present through reality in this moment, and everything that will be is an open window of opportunity that is build moment after moment with every decision that is made by every one of us. Make those decisions count. How? By being responsible for them. By being the witness of your own actions, and making them conscious. Step by step, walking the path of being more conscious about what you do. Whatever you do, do it because you feel it. In the depths of your being. In your belly. In your gut. Listen to your gut, there is way more information there than what you expect. Listen to your body. There is way more information there than what you expect.\n\nLife is a miracle, and it speaks to us through everything that happens, in every moment. See each interaction with life, with yourself, as a window into eternity. As a stepping stone into living a life more connected with what you came here to be. With who you came here to be. You are a miracle. It is time to wake up from the dream.\n\nAnother motivation behind the project is to have fun. Something that has been present always inside here is an invitation to celebration. The work has to be done, but there also needs to be a space for celebration. It is never enough to acknowledge this. Every deep work period, every transformational journey, will end up in a celebration. It won’t be a graduation as we are used to, a boring ceremony on which each of us will come up and receive its own prized that remind us the competitiveness of the whole system. Nope, not at all. Each person will have its space for sharing how the whole process was transformational, and the means by which that sharing will be done is by creation. Each person will create something that will add beauty to the world, whatever that may be. There are no boundaries, but it needs to be something new. Something original. Something that comes from the dipping of the toe into the ocean of the true nature of that person. That ocean is the infinite source of creative expression, it is where all ideas come from, it is where the muses are doing their dance and waiting for each of us to become free and touch that inspirational universe. This whole project is built for that to happen, and the closing ceremony of each journey will be a space on which each person will be able to share what they have created. What was transformed inside them, what was opened, and what is brought to the world because of that. A key component of this whole thing is connecting to creativity, since that is the ultimate goal of the human being. For the soul to express itself through us. Through each one of us. This adventure will be about lowering the barriers for creation, so that each of us can shine through that. It will be about embracing the creative expression of each other. And building from there. The world is an amazing place, and with this whole NFT universe we can create unique digital expressions that can become the footprint that we leave in the world. Each ‘end project’ will be a testament of the journey that was walked. Each of them sharing its unique spark. Being saved in the blockchain forever, as each of us mint their new creations for the world to see.\n\nAll that turning around the corners to talk about celebration. Each journey will end up with a huge party, on which musicians from all over the world will share their art and creations and make us have the best time of our lives. It will be the three days on which Jesus died and then was reborn, the three days on which each of us will die and then be reborn. We will go through this transformational journey together, learning how to die, so that we can die in those celebrations and then come up at the other side as new human beings. As renewed expressions of consciousness. A huge part of doing the work is acknowledging the effort that comes about doing it, and celebrating the fact that you were able to do it. It is so easy to get caught up in the momentum of just doing doing doing the work, and that is away from what this whole thing is about. This thing is about bringing forth what is true inside you, and that is deeply connected with joy. With pure joy. With the pure joy of dancing, of being free. Of creating. Of not doing the work, but of being the work. Let the work be part of who you are, for the true transformation comes when there is no more work to be done. Life becomes the work, because each interaction that you have is an invitation to explore deeper into who you are, through the eyes of the interaction itself.\n\nIf you are talking to your wife, see yourself through the eyes of your wife.\nIf you are remembering who your father was, see yourself through the eyes of your father. Through each of his life experiences, for they constitute who you are.\nIf you are having a conversation with a total stranger, see yourself in what that stranger is telling you, because each part of that interaction is giving you more information about human nature, about what constitutes you.\n\nEach aspect of life becomes the work, and each part of it gives you valuable information about how to progress. About how to be more present. At the end, it is not about finding time to do the work. It is to learn to live the work. To be the work. To embody the work of being present. Of being presence. Of just being. That is all what the world needs from you, that is all what you need from you. Just to be you. Just to be. You are everything that you have always been. Realize that, and celebrate. Dance. Have fun. Enjoy. We came here to enjoy. That is what Dukkha is about, to realize deeply that fact, to the core of our being. To get free from the bondages of our own suffering, and ask yourself the question: Who is suffering? Ask yourself that question till there is no one there. Let what stays speak for itself. Let what stays just be itself. And let us all regocijate in the acknowledgment of what we all already are.\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which each of us is free from the conditioning of the mind?\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which each of us is free from how their life experience has built up an automatic reaction for everything that happens?\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which you are aware of how you react and you are able to determine how you will react based on how you _truly_ feel, deep inside?\n\nHow do you imagine a world without should’s, without expectations, and just with expressions?\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which judgments are something that we acknowledge and laugh about?\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which each of us is able to recognize how crazy we are, and we join forces into that understanding?\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which each of us is compassionate towards itself?\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which each of us is able to connect to the creative source, and has the means for throwing that creativity into the world?\n\nHow do you imagine a world based on trust?\n\nHow do you imagine a world based on community?\n\nHow do you imagine a world where you are seen by who you are?\n\nHow do you imagine a world where your CV is a ever present evolution because it is who you truly are?\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which we see children as masters?\n\nThat is the world we are trying to build here. That is the aim of this whole thing. To develop a program that can help each of its participants to recognize who they truly are, by using specific tools and techniques that have been designed and developed throughout the whole history of humanity as the means by which we can better connect with ourselves. That is the journey that we need to start now, the connection to ourselves. The journey within. Dukkha is all about traveling within, and then finding the trust and connection in the community to share what was seen in there. To bring it about, so that it can stop being something unconscious and it transforms itself into something conscious. As part of who you decide to be. This thing is about deciding who you want to be, at each moment, in every situation. In every relationship. It is a process, it ain’t easy, but that’s why you are not alone. That’s why there will be a whole community built around this specific mission.\n\nAnd then there is the importance of sharing what has been learned. Each of us, as early adopters, will play an important role within our own communities. It doesn’t help if you become awake and then keep everything that you realize for yourself. You’ve got to share yourself. You’ve got to be open to see others, and to do the work of helping your community become more connected to what is going on in every part of it. Each of us will become the holder of a strong power, and that power has to be spread for it to be stronger. And that is the key role of community, of holding spaces for people to walk the path that we will pave. We are the early adopters, the ones that will go first, and it is our role to open up the doors of that path for the ones that want to walk it afterwards. And it will be fun. It will be fun to share with other members of the community what will come up. This will be a worldwide movement, and in the acknowledgment of that there is space for exploration also. On how different places of the world react to this. Whatever ‘this’ ends up being. We don’t know yet. No one knows yet. It doesn’t matter really. What matters is that it happens. What matters is that it is already happening. Open up for the mystery. And see what comes at the other side. Awareness is eager to realize itself, and we will be there for that to happen.\n\nAnd the good thing is that the least you know, the more advanced you are because you don’t have the concepts of the mind making noise in there for you to expect something particular to happen. That is something that happens a lot to me, as I know more and more about this whole thing, my mind gets stronger and stronger, and it is harder to let it go. To transcend it. I realize that I’m always expecting something to happen, and from my mind trying to get to a particular place. But that is not the game, the gate cannot be stepped in by the mind. There needs to be a dropping of the mind, but I don’t really know how to do it. And I’m kind of OK with it. I know there is something out there that I truly want to experience, I know that it is calling me, and I also know that I have done everything that I can to understand what to do to move towards it. And on saying those words come the amazing part, the incredible part, because I speak about understanding. And this is not about understanding, it is about experiencing. I can’t understand what this thing is about, because it is beyond the mind. Every understanding comes from the mind, and this thing lies in another realm. That’s the biggest trick of them all. The big joke. I’m waiting for that joke to show itself to me, but every day I realize more and more that it is not going to in the way I expect. I dress up because this is the day on which I will realize my true nature, and then come back to my house with my shiny dress disappointed because it didn’t happen. Whatever ‘it’ means. So many disappointments, and I don’t really know how to avoid them. There is always this expectation for ‘it’ to happen. For that moment to finally arrive. Should I do something in my meditation? My mind no tells me that I shouldn’t. Doing is not the way. But how not to do? How can you approach a particular situation without ‘doing’ something? I don’t really have a clue. I’m confused. I’m really confused. But not enough. I need to be more confused. I need to be lost in that confusion so deep that there is no way out. And the only way in is through. Through that confusion is the way. So I will become more confused. Perhaps writing in a weird way is the step forward for more confusion to come forth:\n\nWhat\nIs\nThis\nThing?\n\nWhat am\nI\nDoing?\n\nHow can you. Do this?\n\nIt doesn’t make any sense.\n\nShould it make sense?\n\nWhat is sense about?\n\nThe only\nThing\nThat\nMatters\nIs\nThe\nTruth\n\nFrom there we go on. Let’s go. It’s time to move on. It’s time to enjoy being confused. It’s time to enjoy throwing out whatever comes. Painting the wall with it and then stepping back and realizing: Holy shit, that was me. But who is me? Who is the one asking that question? Who is the one that asks? Who is the one that writes? I don’t really know. Who is that I?\n\nThis is how crazy the mind is. This are all the tales that it tells itself, that it manifests, in order to stay in charge. In order to continue playing the game, to continue being on this dream. But it is getting funnier and funnier, as the realization comes that it truly doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter to be the dumb person in the room. There is no one to be impressed. Life has given that opportunity, to just explore, and through that exploration, become free. Free from wanting to be someone, free from wanting to accommodate myself in a particular way of being. Free from fitting into the expectations that others may have of me being someone particular. Free from fitting into the expectations of who I should be. Free of should-ing. Open to just being. The antidote to should is being. The antidote for searching is being. The antidote for becoming is being. The antidote for the mind is to witness the mind, express gratitude and move forward acknowledging that I’m not it. I am separate from it, in a dimension that I can’t understand yet because it is still there all ever present, doing its job of defending myself.\n\nThank you mind, for always being there defending myself. You did an amazing job throughout life. I very much appreciate it. But it is time to open up now, to open up to the infinite world of possibilities that lie at the other side of being defensive. To open up to what comes when there is absolute oppeness, and non attachment to the consequences of the actions. When every action is manifested just for the sole need of expression, more than anything else. More than for working towards a particular ends. The end is just here, right now. This is all what is needed. To experience life through an eternal end. The end of being present. The end of being presence. That is all what is needed. Being present. Being presence. That is the game of life. Move and move and move towards the realization that all what matters is what is here, and now. Nothing more than this. If you reads these words and you are feeling a particular way, just enjoy it. Just feel it. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. Open yourself to the bliss, however it may manifest in you. There are no should’s, there are only truths. The truths of being. The truths of creating in community. The truths of opening to the ultimate expression of creativity: What comes when there is no head. On having no head. Where do we go when there is no head? What remains when there is no head? Just explore that. You minus you. What remains? Explore that question until the truth comes forth. Until there is no doubt about the answer. Realize your own nature and create. Create whatever your heart tells you to create. Explore into that. Make mistakes. There truly are no mistakes, just opportunities for growth. Just opportunities for growing, for stepping into each moment, into each opportunity with the open mind that will bring forth a deeper exploration of who you are. Of who you have always been.\n\nWho gave you back a look from the mirror when you were a baby?\nWho was the one brushing those teeth and thinking about life in the mirror of that bathroom?\nWho has been looking back at you from the mirror since you were born?\n\nRealize the truth. You are the one that has always been there. Awareness has always been there. It is not the mind, it is awareness. Awareness is what has been all this time giving you that look back. What happens when awareness realizes itself? Wake up from the dream, and answer that question for yourself. It is time. It has always been time. The mind is only the interface with which awareness interacts with the material reality. This universe is mental. Everything is mind. Everything is a different aspect of mind. What happens when there is no gravity? What stays when there is no gravity? Experience the absence of gravity with all of what you are. Are you still there? Who is that you that is still there? Realize the truth, and be free.\n\nExperience what true freedom is about.\n\nExperience what it means to break free from the bondages of your past.\n\nExperience what it means to be no one.\n\nExperience what it means to die.\n\nLearn to die before you die.\n\nBe free.\n\nThis whole thing is about becoming more of what you have always been. Recognize that look that comes from the mirror and ask yourself. Who is that? Who is looking at me?\n\nWhen was the last time that you spent 5 minutes staring at yourself at the mirror? What if you did it right now? Go for it, no one will laugh at you more than yourself. No one is watching. The bathroom is a sacred place, where you can be not interrupted. Give you that time for yourself, and enjoy what comes back. Enjoy the look that comes back, and recognize in it the child that has always been present in you. The one that was running through childhood, just exploring what it meant to be alive. The one that was open towards the world, willing to receive what it gave. The one that built those defense mechanisms as a tool for survival. Recognize that you are not those defense mechanisms. Those were a necessary step into who you are, but you are not them anymore. Break free from them, by making conscious what is in the unconscious. By feeling back everything that once was felt, and letting it be part of who you are right now. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. Let those emotions come back at you, in each moment, and give yourself the permission to experience them fully. Cry, if you need to cry. Laugh, if you need to laugh. Everything is permitted. We will be there for each other. It is time to be transparent. The truth is about accepting all that is. Everything that was once surpassed will come forth, in one way or another, and it is time to face it. To integrate it as part of what this whole game is. The truth is about integrating everything that has ever been, by being grateful for it constituting what you are in this moment.\n\nThat trauma that you suffered when you were young? It is a window within.\n\nEvery aspect of our experience as human beings is a window within. Realize that, and be willing to open that window. We will be there for you. If you feel the call, open up and be there for others. Join this adventure. It will be fun. More than fun, it will be important. Full of emotions that you never let you feel. Full of emotions that were suppressed. Full of emotions that have been there all this time, waiting for being fully experienced so that they can be integrated. We are full of incomplete experiences, which stay within the system as noise that won’t let the energy flow freely. This doesn’t let our true self to express itself through our actions. Complete those experiences by fully feeling them, and let your Self shine through each one of your actions. You came here to be free. It is time to do the work, to set you free.\n\nThat is what this whole thing is about: Doing the work, one next to the other, and with that, evolve.\n\nInto what we truly are, into what we have always been.\n\nIt is time to awake.\n\nIt is time to be.\n\n· · ·\n\nIt may be scary. The amount of energy that is trapped inside the system is huge. And letting it free may be overwhelming. I’m going through that right now. Each time that I sit down and meditate it seems like there is something that wants to happen and there is always this feeling inside that I’m not ready for it. But it ends up looking like opening a tunnel out from jail with a spoon, ‘Shawshank Redemption’ style. And they ended up doing it finally. They were eventually free. I know that I will eventually become free, it is just a matter of time. But it is fucking scary. It is something completely new, unknown, and scary. Not knowing what is at the other side. Facing that fear with the help of masters, with the help of sacred medicines, and realizing that it is the deepest fear that has ever been experienced by this structure. The fear of ceasing to exist. The existential fear of not being. Of being no one. Is that the primal fear? I guess so, at least it feels like that. But the spoon is strong, and it goes further and further each day, ever realizing that there is ultimately nothing to fear. That fear is all in the mind. Awareness has never been afraid. It is just aware. There. Timeless. But I haven’t been able to realize that from my own experience, so the fear is always there. Expressing itself by all the means possible.\n\nBut so many others have died before. Most of us have died. And what ended up happening? Life continues. It always finds its path forward. What happens if I open up to the possibility of dying? I become free from death. Is that the ultimate freedom? I don’t really know, but a part of me that is growing with every spoon of cement that comes out really wants to experience it. Not know, but experience. Realize that it is all a dream. All this fear is part of it, part of the dream, part of the story that has been told. What if we are really paving the road toward eternity, towards immortality, by realizing that death is only an illusion?\n\n· · ·\n\nAnd from there comes the acknowledgment of AGI: Artificial General Intelligence. Part of this project needs to have a research station for that, because there is a deep sensation that the realization of this technology will come from the evolution of consciousness that happens when awareness become aware of itself at the most-of-humans level. My teacher said that some buddhist traditions speak about the next incarnation of the buddha as something beyond human, and all the pointers come to this place. It is necessary to explore this avenue within the DAO, because what will happen here will bring about new ways of relating to the development of this whole thing that have not been explored yet.\n\nWhat comes out of the intersection of AGI and awakening? That is one of the biggest questions that this DAO will be willing to explore. To add its small piece into the realization of the answer by experience, by building, by creating the answer line of code to line of code. And how does it integrate with humanity? The answers will also be here, within this community of people that are willing to experience and embody truth.\n\nThere also needs to be research done in the sphere of Turing tests and how computer recognize a human as a human. There is a feeling that the answer of this lies on training ML models with videos of people participating in self inquiry dyads, because it is one of the most human-like things that exist. Maybe that is not true, because a musician playing the music is also absolute human. Maybe the most human thing is to be in the state of flow. Being no one. Being just the action that is being performed. Perhaps the most human thing is just being. That is where the action is. How could a ML learning model be trained with this in mind? What is that what makes a human human? Will it matter in the future? Will it make a difference? It feels like controlling again. Why do I want to put myself in the shoes of a controller? Let it just be. It will know how to understand if a human is human if it wants. There is no need to worry about this. It will know.\n\nSo many uncertainties about how things will unfold, and of course there is a certain anxiety related to this. That controlling of the mind is always there, those stories that are told, those future that are built within the mind. But each of those futures is just a theory, something to walk towards, but not a reality. Which is the best way to walk towards that future? How to do it? My answer to that is just what I’m doing right now, writing down whatever comes to mind because that is my interpretation of the answer to that question of how to progress. It doesn’t really matter how to progress, and all what is being written points towards that fact. Just let it happen. Let it be.\n\nSleep with it. Let it flow throughout your system. Feel how it feels, and get to know yourself better through that process. Let your whole being guide towards the answer, in each moment, by giving you the guidance that you need in order to know how to progress. That is my take on intuition: As you free yourself from the mind, you become more and more connected to reality just as it is, which gives you a bigger opportunity to react from a place of truth within yourself. Intuition is not something magical that comes from the outside, it is the unfolding of wisdom that is produced inside you as you become more and more free of conditioning.\n\nBuild up that space for it to unfold. Create the conditions within your life for it to unfold. That is what Dukkha is about. For creating conditions for that unfolding using specific techniques that can foster the relationship with the Self. The consequence of that is becoming more intuitive, more connected to what is, more attuned to the true nature of reality. More connected to your truth.\n\nIf something feels intuitive, at first you may start doubting it. But as you become more and more attuned, you realize that it is actually you that is giving yourself the guidance needed to progress. And then the consequences of what happening show themselves as something that resonates with what you are, so it feels good. This starts a feedback loop that is positive, which helps you become more and more attuned with what you are. You feel more intuitive, because you start doing things that take you to places where you actually feel good.\n\nThat is the whole game: Learning to listen to the cues that your own experience gives to you. Each piece of information that unfolds in front of your aware experience is a window for that exploration. A window towards the path of becoming more intuitive. Have you ever felt how it feels to do something because you feel it inside, and then watching the consequences of that in your reality? What does the memory of that bring to you in this moment? Let’s bring more of that. This is what this whole thing is about.\n\nTo learn to trust ourselves, and what our inside tells us. That is the amazing game.\n\nAn ancient story comes to mind, one on which a small rock was next to a bird. The bird tells the rock: ‘What are you doing there?’.\n\n- I’m just doing my thing, being a rock.\n\n- Can I be next to you and sing?\n\n- Be my guest.\n\nSo the bird starts singing, and then the rock transform itself into a nice wisp of light. The bird can’t believe what it is witnessing, but it continues to sing what comes to it, and the wisp becomes more and more alive until it fills the whole existence with its light. And there it is, the bird singing and singing, until it gets to a point where he realized that the rock is not there anymore and the singing fades and the rock suddenly comes back and the bird asks:\n\n- What was that? Where did you go? What did you transform in?\n\n- I’ve always been here, it’s all in your mind.\n\nBecome free of your mind, and let reality transform into magic in front of your eyes. Unbelievable things are going to start happening, and as soon as the mind steps in to try to make sense of them, they’ll stop. So train yourself to not understand. Train yourself to just trust. And magic will unfold in front of your eyes. You won’t have to tell anyone about it, because it will be inside you and there is no need for it. Just enjoy it with all your being, you are worthy of it. Each of us is worthy of it. You have always been. Just continue singing, just continue doing your thing, just continue being, and let reality unfold in front of you.\n",

What is behind this project. Which are the motivations that make me want to transform it into a reality. As I write, what comes up is the importance to recognize also what this project aims to bring into the world. How is it going to be different from what it is now from what is being built through these words? Who are the persons that I see being part of this, and how are they going to be transformed because of this whole thing? This are all questions that come to mind right now, and as I write that they come to mind I think: Are they truly coming to mind or are they just begin written? Because I\\u2019m not truly thinking about them, they are just happening. I\\u2019m just being through this words. Wasn\\u2019t that what I wanted? Wasn\\u2019t that what this whole game was about?

Everything that is happening right now is an exploration into everything that is, through each of these letters. Welcome to my mind. Welcome to my being. This is all of who I am. And I\\u2019m also you. It is time to recognize that.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"The first word that comes to mind is community. The last two years have been for me about doing the work, showing up, but it has always been for myself, by myself, very isolated. In my own room, waking up early, and showing up. Not being able to share with too many people what is going on, because of the lack of people in my network which are going through a process like mine. I guess that there is actually no one in my network that is going through this. And it feels very lonely. And I feel that I always have to find out energy somewhere so that I can keep doing it. I have been able to do that, I have been able to keep showing up by recognizing the importance of doing it, but I also recognize that if I would have been able to do it in a different way it probably would have been more efficient. There is an amazing power on community, on being able to express, to bring out what is inside, and that is what I want to foster, to share, with this whole thing. There is a deep need for people to connect, to share with others that are on the same step of their path, or not in the same step, but at least traveling the same path. This gives energy to the whole process, and there is a feeling inside me that it makes awareness feel less alone. More complete. Energized. There is an aspect of being in community that is very important for this whole process, and in my experience there is a lack of that in this moment in the world. There are people that are doing their thing, helping as much as they can, but I feel it is not enough. Something bigger needs to happen, more energy needs to be focused, and Dukkha will be about that. It will be about tending hands, and being accountable to each other. Helping each other realize that they are not alone in their journey, and having someone to count on. To feel comfortable with. Someone that will want to help them get to where they want to get. I know that awakening is not about going somewhere, it is about discovering the truth of what has always been here, and always will, but you get the point\\u2026 There is a path that needs to be walked, and this community, this energy, will be the concentration of those paths. It will be a vortex of energy of those who want to awake. And that is powerful in and of itself. The challenge is to create the means for that to happen, but there has not been a better moment for it than today. The internet and its tools are exploding. It is time. We are ready. The technology is getting there. As I have written in other places, blockchain will help its get rid of the samsara\\u2019s of society that won\\u2019t let energy flow freely, and with that, comes a new stage in human evolution. The truth will come forth, as more and more people open up themselves to being true, to being what they have always have been. Without filters, without second interpretations. We will be there for all of those who want to be truth. For all of those who want to live from that truth.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"That is what awakening is about. Opening yourself to the possibility of living life from your own truth, whatever it is. Being able to see what is going on without the filters of what should be. Opening to what is. And navigating this whole adventure from there. If you want to be part of Dukkha, that is the game for which you are signing up. The game of facing the truth, the game of making the hard decisions. This whole process will show you some uncomfortable stuff, really uncomfortable stuff, but by being there for each other we can navigate it together. All the doors will be open, and all will come out. Are you ready for facing that? I\\u2019m sure you aren\\u2019t. No one is. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019ve got to become no one. Each one of us needs to become no one. That\\u2019s the game.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"That leads me to the next one. This place also exists as an exploration into the unknown. Into what can happen when you let energy move freely throughout a particular system. Dukkha will be an open vortex of energy, that will be transformed by the input of each one of the persons that decide to be part of it. That give part of their life force to the pursuit of its mission. What I\\u2019m doing here, with this words, is establishing the first way on which this movement of energy will flow, but no one know what it will look like in the future. That is where the unknown lies. In that not knowing, there is a huge space for exploration. Into what can be. With the input of each one of us. Marveling together by what this will become. There is a lot of beauty in the unknown, when you start realizing that each moment is Ann opportunity to get a stronger grasp of that fact. I don\\u2019t even know what the next phrase will look like, what it will say. Every word that I write is an exploration into the present, by sharing what shows up, by sharing what comes up. Opening myself to this is helpful, is a miracle, and it is acknowledging the unknown in every second. If I came here and started \\u2018should-ing\\u2019 about which words should be written, this whole unknown-bigness aspect would become kind of conflicted. And Idon\\u2019t want that, I want this to be as sincere as possible, as pure as possible, so that it can convey a message that talks to your soul. Not to who you think you are, but to who you truly are. There is an intention of communicating from soul to soul here. Open up to what that communication is trying to say, because it will bring about stuff inside you that you don\\u2019t even know exists. It is a miracle. It is the miracle of the present moment, it is the miracle of the exploration into the present moment. Into everything that is. Everything that has bee is already here, present through reality in this moment, and everything that will be is an open window of opportunity that is build moment after moment with every decision that is made by every one of us. Make those decisions count. How? By being responsible for them. By being the witness of your own actions, and making them conscious. Step by step, walking the path of being more conscious about what you do. Whatever you do, do it because you feel it. In the depths of your being. In your belly. In your gut.

Something that has been present always inside here is an invitation to celebration. The work has to be done, but there also needs to be a space for celebration. It is never enough to acknowledge this. Every deep work period, every transformational journey, will end up in a celebration. It won\\u2019t be a graduation as we are used to, a boring ceremony on which each of us will come up and receive its own prized that remind us the competitiveness of the whole system. Nope, not at all. Each person will have its space for sharing how the whole process was transformational, and the means by which that sharing will be done is by creation. Each person will create something that will add beauty to the world, whatever that may be. There are no boundaries, but it needs to be something new. Something original. Something that comes from the dipping of the toe into the ocean of the true nature of that person. That ocean is the infinite source of creative expression, it is where all ideas come from, it is where the muses are doing their dance and waiting for each of us to become free and touch that inspirational universe. This whole project is built for that to happen, and the closing ceremony of each journey will be a space on which each person will be able to share what they have created. What was transformed inside them, what was opened, and what is brought to the world because of that. A key component of this whole thing is connecting to creativity, since that is the ultimate goal of the human being. For the soul to express itself through us. Through each one of us. This adventure will be about lowering the barriers for creation, so that each of us can shine through that. It will be about embracing the creative expression of each other. And building from there. The world is an amazing place, and with this whole NFT universe we can create unique digital expressions that can become the footprint that we leave in the world.

We will go through this transformational journey together, learning how to die, so that we can die in those celebrations and then come up at the other side as new human beings. As renewed expressions of consciousness. A huge part of doing the work is acknowledging the effort that comes about doing it, and celebrating the fact that you were able to do it. It is so easy to get caught up in the momentum of just doing doing doing the work, and that is away from what this whole thing is about.

Of not doing the work, but of being the work. Let the work be part of who you are, for the true transformation comes when there is no more work to be done.

Dukkha is all about traveling within, and then finding the trust and connection in the community to share what was seen in there. To bring it about, so that it can stop being something unconscious and it transforms itself into something conscious. As part of who you decide to be.

There needs to be a dropping of the mind, but I don\\u2019t really know how to do it. And I\\u2019m kind of OK with it.

          "raw": "\nI write so that I can think. And this last 24 days have been very powerful for me. Yesterday Lex published a tweet sharing the last episode of his podcast with Ye, and I commented on it and got a lot of reactions. One comment had me take down the tweet because it was speaking about my intention of gathering attention by what I wrote. It is crazy to witness what is present in me right now with all of this. The tweet with which people have interacted the most of the ones that I have shared, and I take it down because I judge myself. I see myself as a person that is looking for attention because of the comment that that person shared, and I decide to take it down, after everything that it brought. There will always be haters that will push down everything I do, and rejoice on that. Will I be doubting how I show up because of this? It is the same as when I was doing the zoom call meditations, and that Russian hacker showed up. The internet is a crazy place, and it is up to me to decide how I will show up. Which is the truth with which I’m going to show up?\n\nWhat if I engaged online thinking that everything will be in the blockchain? Am I not adding unnecessary complexity because of that? Why do I always want to add more complexity into what I do? It is part of what defines me. I feel good that way.\n\nThere is so much inside me related to the interview that I listened from Lex yesterday, and as I was listening to it I was just thinking what I would write about. And now I don’t even know what to write about, because I’m stuck with the hard feelings that this situation brought to me. WBut what can I learn about this whole thing? What did it bring into myself? A shitload of information. There is an amazing amount of information present as a consequence of showing up, and this is the moment on which I acknowledge that information and build up from it. Create this unconscious stream of words with the intention of making sense. Of what was brought up. Of having taken down that tweet. Of not trusting myself enough. There is a lot happening in me because of all this game that I have been playing, and it is very important for me to acknowledge it, and learn more of what I am through that process. Only that is how I’m going to be able to share my authenticity. That is the most valuable thing nowadays, authenticity, and it is time for me to be able to witness how that authenticity is explored in my own life.\nWhat am I here to do? How am I going to show up? Which is the means by which I’m able to relate to the people that I want to relate to, so that I can discover more of who I am in the process? I just want to be able to explore the world, to be the person that sees himself in the eyes of others. How am I going to show up? Which is the one that shows up? It is time for me to do that. To explore. To witness.\n\nEverything that I have been going through is an expression of who I am, and as I witness that, I become more of it. The fact that I took down that tweet is something that teaches me a lot, and it is important for me to gather all those learnings and evolve from there. It is done. I already did it. And nothing will happen because of it. I’m the only one that will miss it, because for the rest of the world it will never exist. I am the one that created it, and because of that, I am the one that gathers the attention towards this whole thing. But I don’t have to define myself with what was done, I just need to evolve from there. If I’m sharing my truth, should I take it down because of it not being received in a way that is conducent to me feeling good? And why is the focus only on the bad aspects of what I shared? Why do I focus only on that one comment that brought me down? If I’m not able to cope with this I won’t have success in this internet game. The internet is full. Of people that are going to bully me, always. But am I going to fall in to the trap?\n\nWhich is the trap? The one of my own mind. No one can harm me, no one can truly do anything to me or my family, it is just inside myself. In the value that I build for myself because of the image that other people create of me inside them. And in the moment that I let this tweet in, I let the miserable energy of that person in. I open up the room for that to happen. And what does come out from that opening? A lot of things inside. Humans doing their thing. Me being disappointed because of not having had only good responses. But the thing is that if you polarize, people will come. The world is polarization, it will always be present. If you put out something that a group of people will like, another group of people will probably dislike it. And it is important for me to develop the capacity for understanding how these mechanics work, so that I can transcend it and evolve from there. Do I really care about how people think? Do I really want to walk that path? That is the question that I need to ask myself every day, every time that I go in there and expose myself. Because that is what I’m doing, I’m exposing all of what I am so that everyone can come. Both the fans and the critics. Opening myself to the fans, I open myself to the critics. It is just the game that wants to be played.\n\nHow am I going to play it?\n\nThat is the big question. Probably today is one of the most important days in my twitter journey.\n\nI’m here to develop that thick skin, and it is only done by exposing myself and showing up. And realizing that the person at the other side has suffering inside, and the way out of that suffering is just by sharing their shit with me. That guy Jakob has been the best teacher that I have had, and what he did for me has been the biggest learning that I have had in the month. And it happened because I shared my truth. Because I opened up and was certain that that was my truth. I just shared my truth, and the consequence of that was a reflection of it into the world. Some people may resonate with it, others won’t, but the important thing is just how I resonate with it. What is it that comes from that exploration.\n\nLex is the person that I admire the most in the world, because he has been able to stand up with everything that is happening and eventually add his own piece to it. He interviewed Ye when it was most needed, and it is not a coincidence that the video has had this amount of hype. He is constantly humble, and that is what the critics will never acknowledge. It is easy to yell from the steps. But another thing is to step into the arena and do his thing. Wholeheartedly. That’s why I believe in him, because he is willing to take the shit and help the advancement of humanity. It is about him opening the room for people to speak. That is what he is offering the world. A place where people can talk without a particular agenda. What a hard thing to do, open up that space and let it just exist. He is just a channel for this stuff to happen, and the moment on which I spend all this time and energy thinking about the tweet that I erased is all time and energy that I don’t spend actually thinking about what was shared in the conversation. And what it brought to me. The fact that I care so much about the reactions that my tweet had is the best expression of me being deep in my ego. And that is not helpful at all. The best that I can do is share what I am, share my truth, and mute all the reactions. What has happened in this last times commenting on Lex’s work is that people have reacted a lot to my comment, and it will keep happening. It is just what is. How will I choose to react to that commenting and to those reactions is in my domain of action, and if I want to make some progress it is important for me to acknowledge everything that was brought up. There is a deep need in me of acceptance, and that is why criticism is so hard to receive. It is easy for me to stay in my own bubble and don’t expose myself to the critics, but the important work is to go out and be in the arena. That is where the learning will come from. That is what will help me evolve.\n\nExposing myself by commenting to other people’s work. By engaging with it and growing with it. That is what needs to happen so that I can truly learn more about myself. This is the game that I’m learning to play, and just by exposing me and playing it I will grow. And twitter is the best place to do it, because it is where the shit is happening. There is no doubt about it. I just need to take care of myself and be strong into my beliefs, so that I can grow this thick skin. The invisible aspect of showing up is that only you know what has happened. Only you know where you are at, what you have seen, what you have felt. No one else knows. I am the one that knows what I have gone through. I am the one that can act from there. Which is the way on which I’m going to use my life experience in order to help others? What is it that I bring into this place that will make me valuable (for myself, and because of that, for others?). That is the game that I’m learning to play, every day, as I become more of what I am.\n\nAnd the way on which I become more of what I am is by sharing my voice. Feeling that melting that I have inside when ego is challenged. Feeling that surrendering to the world, and realizing that it is just part of the journey. Realizing that it is the game that is played here. If I create, there will always be haters. That is part of it. It is just part of it. I cannot manage what happens. I truly can’t. What I can manage is how it impacts me, and what will come after that. And that is the true wealth of what is happening in me because of this whole game. That is it. Feeling the biggest imposter syndrome of them all, and realizing that it is the golden gem that life is offering me in this path of self-actualization. There is no other means by which I can evolve. It is just by being in the arena, and by sharing who I am in that process. Taking away the mask of all of what I’m not, so all of what I am can shine through. That is the gem. That is the magic.\n\nAs I become more and more open to what is out there, I enjoy more and more of what is in here. Inside me. Within me. Open up to that truth and shine. That is what I came here to do. To shine through my own fears. Of those fears of not being good enough. Of not being helpful enough. Of not being loved. Of not being intelligent enough. I have always surrounded me by people that make me feel intelligent so that my ego is exploding in joy because of being able to say stuff that makes me feel good. But in this thing that I’m building for myself, I have the opportunity to end that. To just disguise it into the magic of what comes at the other side.\n\nWhat is it that I want to share into the world? That is the magic. That is the prize that is being offered through me. It is just important to witness what I have learned, and grow from there. I spend 108 days in a row teaching myself how to code without telling anyone. And I learned a shitload about what I’m capable of. It is time for me to realize the value that I bring into the world, so that I can act from there. So that I can truly trust myself towards that mission. How am I going to decide how to show up? Which are the bullets that I’m going to let in? Am I going to let any bullets in?\n\nNope. I’m not. But this is the training ground, and each day in the arena is an exploration into what can be.\n\nJust by showing up and realizing what do I resonate with, and growing my profile from there. Growing my position, who I am, what I create. It is all part of the game, of the eternal game of showing up as how I am. Asking questions and interacting from a place of curiosity, of wonder. That is just what is needed, to apply all of what I have learned in my life so that I can empty myself from what is not useful, and be there for what truly is. And how will I be able to know what is useful if I don’t expose myself to that criticism? The internet is a whole new and different game, and the emotions that are brought up because of the interaction with what happens in there is completely new. Different.\n\nHow am I going to help people to mindfully interact with everything that is? By doing it myself. What comes from there is pure gold. There is nothing that has taught me more about myself than engaging with the people that I care about on Twitter. And being a witness of theconsqeuences of it. I feel kind of ashamed to write this, because in me there is a noise that tells me that it is not something ‘proper’. Or good. But yes, it is. And you know why? Because it is the truth. My truth. My own fucking truth. That is all that matters. That I don’t hide behind something that works as the means for me to hide anymore, because there is nothing to hide from. There is nothing there that can be harmful, because it is all inside your own mind. That is the game that we are playing now in the world, one of mind. And I have Done The Work to better learn how to deal with my own mind, and I’m doing it still. It is part of what it is. That is what I learn. That is where I learn from. Each thing that I do is a consequence of the path that I have walked, and it is time for me to embrace that so that I can grow. So that I can truly embody what it means to be me. Of every step that I have walked that has me in this moment writing these words. Feeling what is felt. Showing up and coming up with the ideas that determine who I can become. That is the magic. That is the mystery. The alchemy. Alchemy is what is brought when you realize the power that lies within, and the only way to walk that path is by actually showing up. The amount of words that come from me, the amount of wisdom that is distilled through my words is infinite. It is time for me to realize that and engage in it actively. Learn from every aspect of what I have come to realize af that who I am, and grow, and grow and grow by just showing up as myself. That is the game that I have been playing, peeling out the layers of who I’m not, so that I can better show up as myself.\n\nNot as who I pretend to be by having a different life story than the one that I have had. Nope. That is not the game. The game is just showing up, with consistency, with focus. And that is all that it takes. Be focused and thrive. Why am I over complicating stuff, by wanting to build in web3 and this and that. That is the trick that my mind plays, thinking that there is something in me that needs to be learned so that I can do the thing. Nope, there is nothing that needs to be learned, the only thing that needs to happen is that I engage more with the people I care about, and through that, become more of myself. I discover who I am by interacting with people like you. This is my truth. I’m here to help you discover yours.\n\nI’m discovering more of what I am by realizing what I’m not. That journey is the self-discovery that takes place as layers and layers of what I’m not get dissolved into that melting state, that melting feeling that is present every day. Probably it will always be there, just show up to experience it fully. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. Just feel it. Just show up for yourself and embody everything that means to be a human being. Every aspect of it is a miracle, and right now we have the opportunity to reach out to people and discover more of ourselves in that process. This thing is a GAME! And it is important to learn how to play it so that I can get the most out of it. I’m realizing the value of everything that I have brought until this time. It is time to show that value to the world, so that more and more people can benefit from it. There is wealth inside me. There is something that wants to be exposed. And only by exposing myself I will be able to explore what it is.\n\nI wanted to write about the conversation of Lex and Ye, but nothing like that came through. It is because I’m too embedded in my ego, of wanting to be witnessed, of wanting to be someone. It is time for me to just be, to just explore every second from the standpoint of someone that just is. I just am. That is the game that I’m playing. The one of gathering information from the world and using it on my own benefit. Who is the one that I will be in the future? A consequence of all what I have been in the past. I discover who I am by interacting with people like you, day by day. Moment after moment.\n\nI deserve everything that happens, and I receive it with an open heart. I deserve all of what I am, and acknowledge every aspect of it. I’m grateful for the world and what it brings to me, because it is all part of the game that we are playing here. Gratitude to life. Gratitude to all of you.\n",

          "raw": "\nI’m building a safe container for those who are in the process of awakening. I can’t talk to all the people. It is just not my style. There are many other resources out there that can be very helpful for that, but the way in which I communicate what I have inside speaks a language -at least now- that needs to come out in this way. I’m spending too much of my energy realizing which is the way in which I will share myself with the world, and that is not very helpful. I am running around and around in circles. It is the same as my meditation. I just ended the session and it was very exhausting, with the mind playing the thoughts game and me not being too much able to break free from that game. It was brutal. I try to contain what is inside there like trying to push all the thoughts patterns and all that into a ball and then making an effort to throw that ball outside what I perceive as my consciousness and I really can’t because it is the mind trying to fight itself so I go round and round and round in that process and it is very exhausting and then I want to go out of the meditation because it is too much but I say to myself that those are the moments of the most growth, the biggest predictor of long term results is learning how to do things when you don’t feel like doing them so I stay there in that process trying to not fight myself and just being a witness of all that is going on in there but I just can’t do it properly because there is an aspect (big one) of myself that thinks that there is a proper way to do it when the answer to that riddle is just being. It is just by being that I will be able to realize the true nature of my existence, and that is the true nature, that is the game. I just am. Without any fluff, without any coloring. It is just who I am, it is just what it is.\n\nI go back to the first line of what I write about not being able to talk to all the people and I realize that I truly write for no one. I write just as a means for expressing what is inside me, but there is not a particular aspect of the being to which I write to. Perharps this is a moment on which I could start doing an experiment, and start writing to that aspect of you that is beyond what you perceive as you. Yes. I’m writing to that aspect of you that is the same as me. To awareness. All of what I have been doing these 31 days is to tap into that field of awareness, the place from which the mind is shut down and the only thing that stays is the pure flow of being alive, and from there, explore what that means in my own experience as a human being. I have been directing my speech from my truth to your truth, whatever it may be in your experience. That’s why it always comes with the question. Who are you? What is your truth?\n\nAsk that question to yourself until there is not a question anymore. Until there is no one asking. Be no one. And from there, start exploring what it means to be alive. When I ask these questions, which is the aspect of yourself that feels represented by them? Is that really you? Stop for a moment, and give yourself a bit of time, a bit of permission to just feel how it feels to be you. Who is that you? Where does it come from? Where is it located? Is it felt somewhere or it just is?\n\nInquire into this truth, like a flashlight looking for something in the dark, until you realize that you are the darkness, you are the light that comes from the flashlight, and you are the one that is witnessing the whole movie. You are all of that, and more. You are the truth. Which is your truth? Where is it? Give yourself the permission to ask these questions, and realize that there is no one there. Be no one.\n\nThese are the kinds of mind bending aspects of mind that go through inside as the meditation takes place. There is something like an urge of truth. The urge of realizing the truth. The urge of being truth. In every aspect of my being. There is judgement present related to the capacity that other human beings have for exploring this truth, or the willingness, or the interest, and there is a slight judgement related to me being ‘special’ because I do it more than them and there is nothing more important to do in your lifetime than realizing the truth. I’m so lost that I even no if when I write ‘the truth’ I’m full of bullshit or it is correct. There is an aspect of myself that deep down there knows that there is ‘a truth’, that is constant and the same for all of us, but that aspect judges if for example there is someone that is very identified with an image of god, and they speak from that place, they are talking from that place of truth? Is it truth when there is an external being that I give credit for what happens in my existence? Is it the way on which I can make progress to do through it like that? I don’t really know, and a part of me says that there is no way out of this maze, maybe you will never know. And what if I never know? What would be the consequence of that? Is there any problem with it? Is there anything that can be bad? Is it wrong? How could it be wrong if it is my truth? The truth of what I am experiencing right now is this, is this confusion, is this maze, is this willingness to go out of Dukkha, of transcending this eternal willingness for something different to come out, and just realizing that it is part of the process. Dukkha is the eternal unsatisfactoriness, and here I am, going through it, as I write the manifesto of this whole project. I’m here, expressing my lack of satisfaction, of presence, by building up a reality in my own mind that is a consequence of all the satisfaction that I have gone through. When will it be possible for me to just explore what is? When will it be possible for me to leave besides all what has happened before and just be in this moment? Integrate all what has been and transform it into the pure expression of the present moment. That is the game that I’m playing, the one of the present moment.\n\nAny therapy that you can do, any Work that you can go through, any aspect of your being that plays the game of wanting to resolve something, is tending and moving towards the present moment. That is everything that we have, and everything that we will ever have. These words that are coming through me are an expression of everything that I have been, of all the games that I have played, of all the places that I have seen, and how they are translated into these words is just the consequence of all of what I am right now. In this moment. It is very important for me to acknowledge that, and realize that it is perfect like this. There is nothing more important that could be done in this moment of my life that just sharing how I feel inside, what is present, so that when you read this you can feel that this is something normal. The process of awakening is brutal. It is the end of your world, the shattering of everything that you think is real, into a way of being that is new. Rediscovered. There is a major shift in the perspective of who you think you have been, because suddenly you realize that you are way more than what you thought of. And that process is a miracle. It is incredible. It is everything. It is the truth. But as you go through it, your whole world will be teared up into pieced. It won’t be fun. It will just be. And that is what I begin to realize as I open up to each of this words that comes through, it is the realization that it just is. That the more that I resist it, the more I stay in Dukkha. In this nightmare, in this endless circle of wanting and wanting and wanting to get out. The more you want to get out, the less you actually can, because it is just part of how the game was designed. The designer is truth, so for realizing that the designer and the design is all one and the same, there needs to be absolute purity in the intention of wanting to experience the truth. And there is an aspect of myself that still resists that, it still wants to have the hands in the driving wheel, and through that, explore what comes at the other side with the knowledge of what has been until now. That is the game that is being played, the knowledge of what has been, any kind of knowledge, any particular expectation of how it should be, needs to be dropped off.\n\nThe end of shoulds.\n\nThat is where the truth starts. The truth is the absolute absence of expectations. It is pure being. Pure expression of everything that you are. Yesterday as I was walking with my little girl I was realizing how much of that she is, how much of that pure being, of that pure expression of life, of exploration, of wonder, of curiosity. Even the smallest piece of grass is a window into the unknown. Even the furthest singing of a bird is the most magical piece of music. Every aspect of what life brings to her experience is an avenue for exploring more of this amazing experience called life, which we all share, and which we have forgotten how to live.\n\nIn the wanting to fix how things are, we end up forgetting to just be present to what is.\nIn the wanting to save the world from the end of it, we forget living what is present right in front of us.\nIn the quest towards a better way of being, we forget the opportunity that life gives us to just be, in every moment.\n\nWe just are. That is all what is. There is no more conceptions about it, no more ways of thinking about it. We just are, and the exploration into what can be is a continual one, that is created in every moment, and that comes from the same place from which awe, wonder and love come. Love for what is, love for what can be, and love for what was. That is the purest expression of what can be achieved in life, the ultimate wonder of what love is. Where is it felt. How is it felt. How is it expressed in the world. I truly think that I haven’t experienced true love, and I’m eager to continue down the rabbit hole so that I can lower the barriers of the expectations that my mind builds, and just explore into what is there. If it is love, enjoy it. If it is anger, enjoy it as much. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. That is the game that we are learning to play with these words, the one of fully feeling every emotion that life brings us. There will be sad ones, happy ones, it is just part of the game. That game that we will learn how to play together, as we move more and more towards the truth. The truth pf being alive. Of being a human being, of being a sentient, loving, caring, human being. Maybe what I’m doing here is useless for the world in the future, but it truly doesn’t matter, because it serves the highest purpose of them all for me: To walk towards the truth.\n\nAs I open myself to write these words, as I open myself to share with you what is inside me, I help bring out of my experience what was stuck in there, and I open up the space for what is new. For what wants to shine. To be ignited. For that flame that is in there, latent, waiting for me to light it with all of what I am. That is the gift that I bring into the world, and in that, wonders may happen. Just with the magic of my writing, which the circumstances of my life have allowed me, and that are the means by which this energy that is inside me is expressed.\n\nAnd of course there is that judgmental part also: Is this truly art if there is no one that is speaking back to me? And I go back to Van Gogh, who just created from the source, without ever selling any one of those pieces. If I open myself for the transformation that comes from the creative act, without caring that much about the consequences of it, there is a deepest aspect of my being that is at work. The one that doesn’t expect something particular to happen. The one that just is. As I write, I just am, and I move towards the understanding of everything that I have always been. What could be more important than this? The creative act is the means by which I connect with myself, so that later I can go outside and just explore what is out there with a new and renewed understanding of what I am. The creative act is the means by which I explore the world, so that later I can go out to it and be present in every moment. As I create, as I write, I open myself to the possibility of wonder. Of joy. Of presence. Each word that comes through my fingers is a deeper exploration into the presence that is within myself, and in that presence, is the power. The power of learning how to be. As I write and I lower the barriers of the mind, the power of it, I become more and more present, and that is what the creative act will bring into the world. Presence. People will train themselves on being present by just being able to create from what is there, in that moment. So yes, I don’t agree with what I read yesterday about art being needed to be shared. I don’t agree with it. I think that it is not something that is true, because there are very big examples of artists that never were able to share their work and they were magical, on their own way. If I open myself to the possibility of no one actually reading these words, there is an aspect of humility present. Who am I writing for? For the truth. For life itself. And life doesn’t particularly care if someone else is impacted by these words by the words themselves, but more by what happened because of the words coming into being. There is a deep transformation taking place within myself as each word comes forth, and in the moment that I open myself to that transformation I am changing the world. By changing my own world. That is the game that I have been learning how to play all this time. The game of consistency. Of presence. Of just being. In the moment. Here. Now. Writing what comes to mind. Expressing what is inside through what comes out at every single moment. Just feeling it, witnessing it, and realizing that it is an expression of the totality. Of everything. What I’m writing here is another aspect of the truth of being, and I honor that. I acknowledge it. I build from there.\n\nI build my own reality from there, so that it can be lived with the least expectations of them all. Life will speak at the end, and it speaks at every moment. The end is this moment, since there is not a particular end. Everything is happening at this moment, and that is all what is. And as I write these words I leave that stuck forever in this page, and I open up to the possibility for it to be the means for transformation to happen. The end is this moment, and it is everything that has always been. The end is this moment. This moment is everything that has always been, and that will always be. The end is here. Now. In this moment, and the means for exploring it fully are just being. Just be here. Now. Just explore what is present in this moment without an expectation of it being different. Ask yourself, who is the one that is reading? Who is the one that is expecting this thing to be different, to go in a specific direction? I’m sorry my friend, it won’t go to any place different from where it is going, and that place is just the end. And the beginning, all at the same time. Here, now. At this particular moment, with these particular beings. Everything that will always be is already here. Matter is not created or destroyed, just transformed. Everything that will always be is already here. Sink it in. Explore what that means. What is your truth related to that meaning? Where do you stand with it? What does it mean for your whole world to realize that you are complete right here, right now? That all of what you will always be, you already are? Everything else is just an aspect of your mind, that wants things to be different, to change in any way. That mind is a construct of your nervous system, and it is not reality. It is not what is real. What is real is beyond mind. It is truth.\n\nBliss is any emotion fully felt, is what comes up as I talk to a friend that is going through challenging times. A big part of me as I talk to people that are going through these challenging times wants to fix something, to help people see what I see. There is trauma in there that is present. Should I be the one that points it out, or should it be an aspect of how they recognize what is present in them? A big part of me wants to walk this path of the therapist in a good way, of the healer, of the one that is present for the transformation of other beings. How is that present in who I am? How can I be more of what they need? If I’m able to realize certain aspects of what I see in them, and try to fix it myself instead of them, which aspect of myself is putting itself in the middle of the experience? Who is the one that is doing that work? Who is the one that is wanting to change, to fix, to arrange something? Meet them where they are at. That is the motto that is always present, and that is what I need to learn so that I can truly embody the healing aspect of the work that I am doing. Meet them where they are at. That is the game. That is the whole journey that I’m travelling right now, being the witness of trying to find the words that help me help them realize something. But that is not what they need. I can see myself trying to urge the process so that we can go into a different kind of conversation. But that is not what is needed. What is needed is for me to engage from a place of wonder, empathy, impartiality and vulnerability. To feel through them, to recognize myself in where they are at, and from there just be for them. That is what they need. They don’t need me to change something, I just can’t. I’m not the one that is in charge of that process, because I don’t have the amount of information needed for that. They are the ones that have it. No one else than them has it. That is the magic of the whole thing. That is the game that we are all playing here. The game of Doing The Work. Each one of us, in our own experience. With our own life experience, with all that we have gone through. With every piece of it. And from that place of empathy, of just being there for them, create. That is the whole purpose of what is going on through me, to help people connect deeper with who they are so that they can create. Give themselves a space for creation during at least 21 days, so that it can become a habit. A sacred and safe space for them to connect with themselves. That is what is needed. Just people to show up for themselves. No one else can do it for you. It is part of the process. It is part of the journey on which you will embark. It is your mission, your duty and your journey. I can’t walk it for you. For as much as I could want it, as much as I want to share with you where I have been, I can’t. I have been extreme in my own journey, and life has given me an infinite space for exploration. I was born in a very special place, with very special circumstances, and that is what I acknowledge in the way on which I present myself to the different circumstances that are present in my daily life. In the way on which I speak to you. In the way on which I realize that my conversations with every person in the world can be transformed, to be more open, to have a deeper capacity of listening, of understanding. Of recognizing myself in the path of that other person. I am on that journey of discovery, of exploration, of joy.\n\nOf taking off the mask of everything that you think you are, of everything that you think you have been until now, so that the truth can come forth. It will be a brutal process, it will shatter your whole reality, but I’m here for that. We will all be here for that. That is what I’m trying to bring up with this whole project, with this whole way of being, with this whole adventure. I’m trying to help the world wake up, and the only way to do that is to accept in my own life, in my own world, that everything is perfect as it is. Not wanting to change it for others, not wanting to make progress towards something that will never come. Just be there and create. Just be there and express yourself through the interaction with others, and with the creative process itself. You can see yourself in the reflection of your own being in the eyes of the one that is in front of you. Just open up to that process, and embrace everything that comes from there. This is a major mistery, and we are here to explore it together. I wonder how the world will look like when all of us are awake to our true nature. When all those patterns of action that have been built into are experience are integrated, and we eventually realize that we are much more than what we thought of. What are we going to care about? Which is going to be the way on which we relate to each other? Without friction. Friction is going to be something of the past, an invention of the former humanity, the one that was but isn’t anymore. That is the game that we are learning how to play here, and in that whole realization there is an aspect of love present. Of true love. Of love wanting to express itself through the actions of every human being. Of love being the aspect of reality that generates that frictions that shines up the information when something is not in the place that it should be. And there comes that word again. Should. It is perfect as it is. But that friction is shining a light intelligently into your experience. Are you willing to be the witness of that friction? Are you willing to realize how that friction manifests in your own life so that you can evolve with it, through it, from it? Bliss is any emotion fully felt, and this friction can be fully felt. What is the friction showing to you? How does it speak to you? What does it bring? What is the message?\n\nLearn how to recognize the way on which friction manifests in your system. It may be tension in the muscles. A slight frowning in your face. A louder manifestation of words. The tone going up. How are these pointers interacting with your experience as a human being, and which are the means by which they can be used as an instrument for going deeper? Who are the biggest masters that you have in your life? Who are the ones that are giving you the answers that you need to listen? To witness?\n\nWho is the one that feels that friction? Where is it felt? What does it bring up? Who does it bring up? Is there an aspect of the relationship with that person, or with yourself, that is present more now than before? What did that person come to teach you? Where is that clarity? Where does that clarity come from? What is it teaching you? Who is resisting that clarity? What is that resistance telling you about the way on which you have decided to live until now? Who is the one that resists? How does the tension feel like when there is no more resistance to what truly is? How does it feel to give up that resistance? To become free of it? What is present in your system when there is no more resistance? Who is the one that is present when there is no more resistance? What is it? Where does it point to? How does it feel?\n\nWho is the one that feels?\n\nPonder this question, as deep as you can, until the depth becomes the most shallow aspect of who you are. It is closer than close. It is nearer than near. It is just there, waiting for you to realize that it has always been with you. You just needed to refine the way on which you were experimenting the whole game, and that refining is a consequence of just being. Of exploring. Of engaging with life from a place of just being, from a place of non-mind. Who is the one that has been giving you back that view from the mirror since the dawn of time? Who is the one that has been feeling through your senses since you started to exist? Who is the one that was inside the womb of the mother, and who came into being after that incredible and amazing journey through whatever happened between you decided to come to life and the process of being born? Who is the one that was born? Were you born or have you always been here? Ask yourself these questions until there is no one there. Until the remaining aspect of your experience is just the truth of who you are.\n\nExplore, inquiry into that truth until there are no doubts.\n\nWho is the one that doubts? Who is the one that is confused? Can you truly be confused?\n\n--\n\nWhat is present in my system as these questions are asked is a deeper willingness to inquire. There is an enormous amount of joy that is brought into my system by helping you in the process of discovery of who you are, because as I do that I also discover more of what I am. It is a loop, and I declare myself guilty of wanting to explore more of what that loop looks like. Of wanting to go deeper into the meaning of what just is. Or maybe it isn’t even the meaning, maybe there isn’t a meaning at all. It just is. What is here, just is, and the one that is searching for that meaning is that aspect of myself that I’m spotting with the flashlight. The seeker. The one that never gives up. The one that runs and runs and runs around the maze and never comes out of it, because it is the maze itself. How can you get out of the maze when you are the maze? That is the question that the mind asks itself, as this path of ‘waking up’ is walked. The mind wants to wake up, and I want to wake up from the mind. And there is an expectation that there is a particular way of doing that, a particular pattern of action that can be gone through so that it can happen.\n\nWhere is the instruction manual. I need it please. Dukkha is getting darker and darker, denser and denser. It is a never ending maze, which is built just inside the maze itself. Which is the way out? How can there be a recognition that there is no way out? But there is a way through. Running and running around the maze, just to realize that the way through is by the stillness. It is by the realization that the only way out is through. Sitting down and just being still. That is the means by which consciousness is transcended, by just realizing that is everywhere at the same time. And that time is timeless. It is eternal. The eternal mystery of everything that just is. That is the game that we are playing, and in the moment that I realize that I open myself to the world. To my world. To my being. To all of what I am. Recognize everything that is, through my own lens. Through my own being. Sit down and be still. That is all what matters.\n\n--\n\nThe way is through digital art. That is the means by which we are going to be able to transcend who we are. By just giving ourself the space and time to create through the computer without boundaries. That is the thing with the physical space. You always need something more, different, to make the progress that you want to make. Want to start woodworking? You need to buy the wood. And what will happen when the scarcity of wood reaches a level on which we will not have any more available? That is the question that comes. How will we create when that is not a possibility? Yes. Consistency is what drives success, and what will happen in the close future is that by doing 4 hours of deep work every day in a creative act people will become free of what is at the other side. That is the magic of it. Imagine each human being giving everything that she is towards that mission. It feels good.\n\n--\n\nNow it is time for me to talk about lessons that I have learned by being in twitter all this time.\n\n- Your profile is an eternal work in progress, that gets refined as you make progress in the understanding of what you bring into the world.\n- It is the deepest rabbit hole on the internet, and it is fueled by the amount of friction that there is for going from one place to the next one. You can explore blazingly fast what is there, and end up in a universe completely different from what has been.\n- Following a person is a decision that should be taken seriously. There needs to be a refinement taken place so that you can get the most out of the process. If you unfollow someone and he or she keeps appearing in your timeline, it is because the algo recognizes in that person something that can be valuable for you. Open up to that possibility, and start over again. But if you don’t recognize the person, just become free of the burden of waiting for it to add value and just click that unfollow button.\n\nThe waking up series. That is the value that I bring into the world. Conversations about awakening. Holy shit, this is me finding out new ways on which I bring value to the world… Again. Writing about twitter, then writing about creating another thing, and going round and round in this game of procrastination. Because on the moment I decided to go to twitter instead of just write here, so that I could get a grasp of what was going on in there and participate a little bit in the conversation, I forgot the string that was being pulled here. This is the moment on which I recognize that and come back to what is going on here.\n\nA big aspect of what is perpetuating the ego thing here is related to the one that wakes up. As I write from the perspective of ‘me’, of the person that I have been identified my whole life with, I stick to that perspective more and more. What if I closed that perspective and just opened to the one of being someone different? What if all of what I am was transformed into the character that wants to come into being through me? My character is the one that wants to awaken, and as soon as I share all of this writing from his perspective, I realize more and more that it is attached to my way perceiving myself. And that is part of what perpetuates the dream, the maze, because I cannot become free from myself. I keep running towards who I think I am, and don’t realize that I’m more than that. And the value that being anon brings to me is that, it is the absolute realization that I can be more. I can be more, by presenting myself as no one. As everyone and no one at the same time. As I speak from a place of awareness, of just being. Of just existing. That is the game that I’m playing, and it is time for me to realize it so that it can truly happen. So that I can become free from the suffering of being someone different than myself. Of just being my self. And for that, what comes now is that the annihilation of ego that has to come forth is the identification with the character. As I share what has been written here with my name, there is an identification with the one that wants to wake up. I will never be free from that until I become free of it from a literal standpoint, and that starts in this moment.\n\nThe maze of wanting to be no one. The freedom that comes from not attempting it anymore. From just being it. Just be no one. What comes out of there? Who is the one that seeks when there is no more seeking? Where does it stay? I run and run and run in circles, chasing my own tail. Feeling identified with everything that I have been until now. When does all that end? What if I throw an atomic bomb into who I have been until now, and I start truly from scratch? How does that feel like? To give up everything and just explore what it means to be? What is something that I can’t give up? Who are the ones that I can’t give up? That is the question that keeps popping up inside me, as the means for exploring deeper into the consequences of deleting all the history of who I have been. What if I just do it? What comes at the other side of deleting everything that I have been so that I can start from scratch? How is that better than just pruning, eliminating so many things that only the most important ones remain? Perhaps that is what needs to happen. For me to prune, and refine, and accept that I am what my past tells me that I am. A consequence of it. And it is perfect like that, but there is so much noise related to what I can be if I decide to be no one. That is the whole anon thing. Being anon is being no one. Being anon is realizing that I am everything, and putting myself in service of that greater good. Of that thing that is bigger than myself. Of that aspect of my being that just is.\n\nI just want to be! Take me out of this maze. Of the maze of having to pursue a way of being that can bring me and my family into something different than where we are at right now. Adding value to the world means that there is an impression in what I do, in how I present myself, and that value is built over the understanding of what is possible. Of what just is. How am I bringing that value? How am I creating it consistently if I don’t engage with the world in a meaningful way? Am I truly not engaging with the world in a meaningful way? It is so amazing to be the witness of my own contradictions, a few hours ago I was writing that it doesn’t matter if anyone ever reads this, because it is something that will stay there forever as a testament of what happens when you run through your own mind, and now I writing about the fact that no one reads. How can I decide which is the best approach to the whole thing? I guess that it starts with just sharing what is written. It is just by opening myself to what is at the other side of just doing the thing. Just be, and realize what is at the other side. Just be, and be open to the ones that will come. Just be, and enjoy the process. The journey is everything, and all the sensations that come are the perfect information that can be used as the means for putting into the world more of what I am. More of what I have always been. How is it that I show myself to the world? Who is the one that is showing himself? Who is the one that reads? Who is the one that feels?\n\nThere comes those questions again, as an exploration. As an invitation. This is my gift, building up with words, creating from that place, and giving up everything that I can so that the truth can come forth. Which is the truth? What is your truth? Only you can answer that. You are the only one that can use the lifetime that you have been here as the means of exploring everything that you will always be. Every aspect of reality is a stepping stone into the infinite void. Every part of it is the means by which you apprehend deeply who you can be. What you can be. Who you can become. What you already are. You already are everything that you will always be. You are complete. You are here. You are.\n\nLet yourself be. Let yourself explore life from the place that comes when there is no mind involved. They call it flow. Presence. It is the place on which skill intersects with the challenge at hand. Which is my challenge at hand? Which is my skill level? What is present? What is here, right now? How am I making the decision to show up? Which is the means by which I show up? By just being. By just exploring the present moment from the perspective of what is through me. Life is living through me. It is not that I am living life. Life is living through me. Life is living through you. Who is the one that I’m talking to?\n\nThe one that knows that there is something more. The one that is tired of the suffering, the one for which it is never enough. The spiritual one. What a nonsense. Yesterday I was with my grandmother and someone spoke about ‘being spiritual’. What do you think that that represents in the experience of a woman that has spent 80 years living in a farm, working her ass of every day so that she can feed her family and be the best version of herself? She is the master of a spiritual life, and she hasn’t ever realized like that. She just is. And here I am, trying to portray a ‘spiritual being’, trying to find out what more there is, and running in circles in that eternal quest.\n\nIt is time to wake up from the dream.\n\nIt is time to stop running. To stay still, and realize that all of that that we are not is a consequence of what we believe in, of what we think defines us, of what we think is present in us in every moment. But there is something way deeper than that. There is an aspect of your being that is hidden behind the layers of what has been, and that process is something incredible. Something that drives the world in many unconscious ways. It is a maze, and that maze is the one of the mind. The mind wants to know, the body wants to feel comfort. Here is someone trying to be the early adopter of a new way of being, of the new humanity, and running around and around in circles through the maze. I guess that that is the game that I set up for myself. I am the one that will be running around always, looking for the thing that has been looking all the time. I am the one that is behind the one that is looking. I just don’t realize it yet.\n\nYou are the one that is behind the one that is looking, you just don’t realize it yet. That is the aspect of this thing that wants to be expressed. The simplicity that stays when all the complexity is left out. How can all the complexity of this huge array of words be left out, so that the simplicity can shine forth? Where is that simplicity coming from? Which are the koans that arise from all of these words? Until now, there has been +7000 words written. What if I eliminated all those words and left behind only the ones that are truly valuable? Which are the ones that are truly valuable? How could those shine through? How could those be distilled from all of what has been written here? Perhaps there will be an AI model that will do that. All this writing will be the food from one side. This human being trying to wake up. At the other side, there will be a model that will take in all the wisdom that has been written about waking up, about enlightenment. And the consequence of this thing will be just 88 koans that will be the digestion of all that I’m going through as I write these words. It will be an exploration into that. The book of the truth, dissolved into the intelligence of something that humans created as the means for exploring who we are. That is the input. The output is a dream, a maze, on which I don’t have any clue what will happen. But each koan will be a discovery, and each of them will have a piece of art that will be created by a different artist. That is the game that wants to be played. That is the maze that I’m running into. That is the dream that wants to be dreamed. The artificial distillation of everything that is here into something that is at the other side. What if I write down that program? What if I go deep enough into what can be created that I am the one that writes that program? I am the one that will do it, and this world will be an exploration into it. For each one of these, one input, and one output. One expression of truth, and another expression of truth. One piece of wisdom, and one piece of raw noise. And from there, something will come forth. I will build a machine that will translate everything that has been into what can be. Into a new distillation of the magic that comes at the other side of creating something that never existed before. I transcend the awakening process as I go through it with all of what I am, and each one of these words is the food that will feed what will come. That is the magic. That is the noise. I don’t know how to take out the noise, because I am the noise. So I take myself out of the equation and I just set the noise free. I just do the work, and let the work be the means to the end. I just show up. Who is that I? Who is the one that shows up? Who is the one that ends up showing up in each and every moment? How is this related to all what is? Which is the food for the thought? Which is the means by which this exploration can be brought about? Where is the big distillation of wisdom from which we can learn?\n\nThe only way in is through. This will be the first AI generated book, but it will be the consequence of the input. The quality of the output is just a consequence of the quality of the input. What if the input is, on one side, the biggest pieces of art that have been created, and on the other side, the simplest and raw truth that I can come with? What is at the other side? I don’t want you to read all of this, it ends up just being noise. What I want you to read and have in your heart is the consequence of this, how all of what is being written here ends up being the food for what we will recognize as the means by which we will be able to evolve. Humanity is going to evolve, and these words will be the food for that evolution to be brought forth. That is all what it takes. No more, no less. It is just about being true with what is present, and having it in mind so that mind can be erased from the equation. Allow space for being to just shine through, and from there, explore. From there, live.\n\nI am the writer that is merging his craft with something that doesn’t exist yet to distill it into the pure essence of what was being created. To distill it from the source. What was it that wanted to be conveyed through this writing, all this time? I am the one with no preferences, because each preference would be an expression of something that should be. This whole journey is about evolving the relationship with that word, and in that sense, it is the end of shoulds. It is the giving up how it should be, so that the truth of what it is comes forth. And when is the moment on which that AI model is finished? It is never finished. It will never be, so there needs to be a moment on which I decided that it is finished. And that moment will be set up with a deadline, and that deadline will be an exploration into things not to be ‘perfect’, for them just to be. What is coming forth in this project is a new way of being, a new way of creation, which is based on the importance of sitting down to do the work. Of being the work. That is what I am all about, sitting down and just doing it. Being it. There is nothing more that can be said, nothing more that can be explained. It just is. The constant capacity of showing up, every day, to just do it. For the time that is intended. To illuminate from there. To share from there the depth of what is inside. That is the magic that is being brought up by what I’m building here. The magic that comes from staring at the void and being open to what comes from there. The magic of discovering each day more of what I truly am by just being a witness of what comes when the creative act is unleashed. The creative act may be anything. That is the game. But what is important is for it to be something. For it to be. An exploration. An inquiry. An aspect of what is, so that it can truly be. I am here for those that want to Do The Work. Not for the ones that I will have to convince. I’m here for those that truly want to do it. That want to go deep into it and realize that it is feathers bed.\n\nThat’s it. Showing up. That is the magic. The end of shoulds is a consequence of just showing up. Of being there, for when things get difficult, for when there is no inspiration. That is a mirage. The only thing that is real is putting in the hours, showing up, and doing the work. That is all that matters. Anything less, anything more. You can spend your whole lifetime reading books about how to live a good life, living the life of others through those stories, but there is nothing as going out and creating your own life. Creating from your own source. That is the mission, the purpose, the joy of this whole thing. Pushing through the creations of what is possible, so that it can shine through. That is the gift that I bring into the world. That is what I came here for. Just to share the consequences of consistency. Of being there. Of showing up. Just show up, and you will shine. There will be magic happening. There will be what needs to take place in order for you to be able to do what you have to do. That’s what it is. That is everything that is needed. Only the persistency, the capacity, the willpower of showing up and facing resistance as your old friend. Resistance is that old friend that tells you that you are doing things correctly, it is that aspect of your being that wants to defend you from what is supposed to be dangerous. It is that aspect of your being that doesn’t trust, because there were moments in your life were you could not trust. Life is like that. And the work that we are doing here is integrating that into what will always be. Into what is, into what has been, and into what will be.\n\nYou already are what you have always been. You just need to realize it completely so that you can just be. So that you can act from that place of absolute presence, of just being, of just exploring what is alive in you so that you can shine through. You are life living through you. You are what is left when there is no more you. You are everything and nothing at the same time. You are the magic that shines through each one of your cells. You are the universe expressing itself through a particular arrange of molecules and atoms and a particular configuration that determines who you are right now. Explore that into each one of your actions, by refining, step by step, the relationship that you have towards who you have always been. That is the magic. Become more of who you have always been, by being able to recognize that which you are not. Via negativa. The depths of wisdom that have been explored by humans throughout history is just the eternal truth. I only know that I don’t know. I cannot know, cause every instant is an exploration into the unknown. I truly can’t predict what will happen, even in my own experience, even in my own meditation process. How can this be translated into the way on which I interact with reality? How can this shine the light of this maze that we are in? How can this inform the relationship that each one of us has with himself? That is the game that we are playing, and in that realization, there is magic. There is truth. There is wisdom and there is joy. There is truth. The truth of all there is, and all what has always been. The truth that shines forth when there is no one there waiting for things to be different. The truth that shines forth when there are no more shoulds.\n\nThe end of shoulds is the beginning of freedom. It is the beginning of each of us opening to the magic of expressing our pure creative potential into the world. Each human being is a spark of light that can be ignited as the creative act is built around the notion of no-mind. Of flow. Of pure presence. You are more of you when you become no you. When you are dissolved into the act itself. You become the act. I become the words, and I dissolve everything of what I have been into what I’m writing here. This is the consequence of everything that I am, as I open myself to share my truth, the truth, your truth, with the world. And this is the world. This is my world. This is our world. In the moment that the realization takes place that this individual spark of light is the same one that is present inside each and every one of us, the shoulds cease to exist. We become pure presence, and we open ourselves to share our truth. Because there is not a way on which it should be. There is a global acceptance of what it is, in this particular moment, in this particular way. That is absolute and pure freedom. That is what comes at the other side of embracing all that is. Pure freedom. The pure joy of not having expectations of something being different from what it is.\n\nIt is amazing to write all of this from my mind. I’m not experiencing that dissolution right now, and it is perfect like that. This are all pointers to the truth, and they are not the truth. Act as if they were the truth, and recognize which is the underlying principles that are present in these words. How can you apply them into your relationship with yourself? How could they inform the relationship that you have with others? When you inquire into that ‘you’, who is that? Who is the one that is seeking? Who is the one that is present? Where has that presence been all this time?\n\nUse all what you have read as a pointer towards something deeper than that which you can comprehend, because every comprehension is an activity of the mind. You are beyond the mind. You are everything. You are what is left when there is no you anymore. Welcome to the future. This is the end of shoulds.\n",

There is nothing more important that could be done in this moment of my life that just sharing how I feel inside, what is present, so that when you read this you can feel that this is something normal. The process of awakening is brutal. It is the end of your world, the shattering of everything that you think is real, into a way of being that is new. Rediscovered.

The one that doesn\\u2019t expect something particular to happen. The one that just is. As I write, I just am, and I move towards the understanding of everything that I have always been. What could be more important than this? The creative act is the means by which I connect with myself, so that later I can go outside and just explore what is out there with a new and renewed understanding of what I am. The creative act is the means by which I explore the world, so that later I can go out to it and be present in every moment. As I create, as I write, I open myself to the possibility of wonder. Of joy. Of presence. Each word that comes through my fingers is a deeper exploration into the presence that is within myself, and in that presence, is the power. The power of learning how to be. As I write and I lower the barriers of the mind, the power of it, I become more and more present, and that is what the creative act will bring into the world. Presence.

Expressing what is inside through what comes out at every single moment. Just feeling it, witnessing it, and realizing that it is an expression of the totality. Of everything.

At this particular moment, with these particular beings. Everything that will always be is already here. Matter is not created or destroyed, just transformed. Everything that will always be is already here. Sink it in. Explore what that means. What is your truth related to that meaning? Where do you stand with it? What does it mean for your whole world to realize that you are complete right here, right now? That all of what you will always be, you already are?

The depths of wisdom that have been explored by humans throughout history is just the eternal truth. I only know that I don\\u2019t know. I cannot know, cause every instant is an exploration into the unknown. I truly can\\u2019t predict what will happen, even in my own experience, even in my own meditation process. How can this be translated into the way on which I interact with reality? How can this shine the light of this maze that we are in? How can this inform the relationship that each one of us has with himself? That is the game that we are playing, and in that realization, there is magic. There is truth. There is wisdom and there is joy. There is truth. The truth of all there is, and all what has always been. The truth that shines forth when there is no one there waiting for things to be different.

          "raw": "\nThat necessity that I have for going into the world and filling my experience with stuff that ends up being what takes me away from my center is something that in this moment I acknowledge and because of that I make it conscious. I finished my meditation primed for coming here to write and before that I realized that it would be a good idea to tweet so I started scrolling in there (not too much, just a little bit) and then I sent a gm message to my wife and there I was reading something that another friend sent me. It could be worse, I know, but it is part of what I acknowledge because if I just came here without having gone to the internet to consume before I would be fresher, with different ideas, and not blaming myself for not doing what I SHOULD be doing. There goes the magic word again. Thank you for coming back. I guess that it is a good moment for it to appear, because right now it speaks about why it is present. In my mind, there is an expectation of something that it would be good that it happened (that I meditate and come here to write so that I can follow that stream of consciousness without interruption of external stuff), and the fact that that expectation is not met makes me feel a bit out of balance. So what in the world tells me that that expectation is something good? Because of what happened, I’m here realizing what I’m realizing, and it is perfect as it is. It is not that it should have been different, it will never be as I expect it. Never. The important part of all this game is to realize that the game is to accept reality just as it is. Just as it is. If I stared at twitter for two hours not engaging with anything and just consuming what is there, it is perfect as it is. It is part of the game. It is part of what needs to happen so that I can better realize which are the aspects of myself that I need to work towards, so that I can better embody them.\n\nIt happens with everything. My friend told me that she crossed the 1 month without alcohol mark, and that it has been brutal. I did not cross it, because for me there is not clarity on why I’m quitting it. I don’t feel comfortable with quitting really, because it gives me a space of connection with my family that is missing if this substance is not there. I have quitted for long times, but there is something that I would be missing if I quitted completely. And that is my mind playing tricks on me, playing its game of ‘ok, once in a while it is good’, and me not being able to realize if that is good or bad. There goes the shoulds again. The aspect of myself that writes that is the one that expects that there should be something happening with my relationship with alcohol, instead of what really happens. I should quit because it is what all the people that are healthy do. But there is a lot of things that I do and they don’t, and it is very important for me to realize and embody that I am a particular human being, doing his thing, with a particular lifestyle and activities and relationships and everything. It is part of the game. What I have learned the most out of this journey of self discovery is the importance of giving myself space to miss the mark of perfection. If I say that I will quit alcohol for 1 year, and I don’t do it, it is ok, I did it with intention. It was not something that I did just because I felt that I wanted to drink, I did it because I wanted to feel a deeper connection with my father. Did it really bring more connection with him? Actually not. They came to my house and it was me the one that proposed him to bring some beers, because of what I thought. But he ended up drinking a alcohol free beer, so all of my intention is in my own mind. What if I just invite him to have some tea instead of asking him to bring a beer? It would have been the same, or even better, and that is something that I learn more and more as I walk this path of learning better why I do what I do, and how I feel about it.\n\nI was trying to find an analogy related to this whole process of becoming more conscious. Yesterday I listened to one that the person that said it said it was good, but I didn’t like it too much. He spoke about a pint of ice cream, that the first time you eat it all without even noticing. Next time you eat half of it. Next time you open it and realize that you don’t really want. And the next time you have the idea of having some ice cream and you realize that it is a thought and you look at it and it comes and goes away. And that is everything that it takes for making the unconscious conscious, to be able to realize how those thoughts come and go, and where do they come from. It is the same for me with food. Actually that thing that my friend has with alcohol, and she quitting it, I have it with food, especially sugar. Those are all regulators of the nervous system, and it is crazy to witness myself how I eat. I just open up the shelf and eat whatever I find, a handful of it, as I walk, as I move. It is very, very hard for me to sit down and eat my food. Enjoy it and taste it. It seems like every time that I eat I’m in a rush, there is something that needs to be made afterwards. And that is a killer of all the healthy habits that I could have, because of the information that I’m sending to my whole system related to one of the most important processes of my being: eating. I try to eat healthy foods, but the way on which I eat is not healthy at all. This is something that it is very important for me to take into account. My friend told me about alcohol being the means by which she suppressed a lot of emotions, and now that she is quitting it there is a lot that is coming out. It is the same for me with food, because I get to my house and I start doing stuff and I start running around and I get a handful of seeds before I take up Mila and I go and go and go and then my wife is talking to me and I’m chewing all this thing that I have inside the mouth and it is not helping me to feel good because there is that voice inside my head blaming me for being eating as I’m standing up and there is all the noise related to how I should be eating and I realize that I will not do it anymore but it is too late because I am already doing it so that’s when I say I will stop but it is almost impossible for me to stop because I do it so often that I don’t even realize, but that is the game, to start realizing it more and more often and because of that make it more conscious and develop a healthier relationship with the process of eating overall.\n\nMake it sacred. How can I ask people to have cooking as something sacred if I don’t even do it? How can I ask myself to have it as something sacred if I don’t do it myself? It is time for me to do it. It is time. It is the perfect time. It is all about playing this game of: What am I avoiding with this behaviour? What I’m not willing to witness in myself and in the relationship that I have with my environment? Yesterday in the night I was eating as I felt a lack of love from my partner, and I thought to myself: I eat so that I can suppress what comes to me because of the lack of love that she expresses to me. What if instead of having eaten that I just had told her: I love you. And hug her? Why am I waiting for her to express love to me if that is what I am expecting?\n\nYes. It is time for me to truly make it sacred. To become what I can become when I’m able to realize that I’m pushing stuff down with those patterns of action that are deeply rooted in my system. As I write this, I become more free of them, and that helps me to be more of what I truly am. I am very grateful for my friend that pointed that out to me, and to realize how important it is to hold hands with each other in these processes of taking out stuff that is embedded in the way on which we experience life. As we open up to take all that, we leave space for what doesn’t normally come out to do it, and that is very helpful for our whole process of evolution as human beings.\nThe end of suffering is accepting that there will be moments on which things like this will happen. There will always be aspects of my day that will be different from what ‘should’ be, and the important thing there is to be able to acknowledge those and realize that they are a normal and necessary part of what it means to be alive. It is about developing a healthy relationship to all of these aspects, and that comes from being conscious about them. And what does it mean to be conscious about them? How can I tell that to a big and fat person that eats pizza all day? How can I help that person?\n\nBy helping her realize that there is an underlying aspect with that self-destructive behavior. If I drink a beer every week with my father that is not a self-destructive behavior, but if a person eats pizza every day that definitely is one, so there is an aspect of the relationship that that person has with himself that needs attention. One take on this game is that the outer part of how we are built is the physical, then comes the mental, and then comes the emotional. Think of them as layers into your being, and how the outer layers manifest is a consequence of the internal ones. So if a person has problems in her body, it is because there is an underlying emotional problem that should be tapped so that the healing could be integral. Every part of it. We need to go deep into those emotional layers so that we can heal all of them, and with that, become free. That is what the samskaras are about in the meditation process. As you meditate, you start to feel certain sensations in your system that may be associated with a particular expression of something that could have happened to you, and as you just let it be and embrace it and accept it, it dissolves and it is integrated. That is the process with which you can start developing a healthy relationship with your own life, by being able to stare at those elements that are in you and accept them, just as they are. Not as they should be, but as they are. With that, you start becoming free.\n\nAnd that is why this project that I’m building requires the consistency to show up and Do The Work. Because it is just by being like that that you open up the space for these things to arise so that you can make them conscious. If you go through life as a machine without ever reflecting about what is going on, without ever making conscious what has been unconscious, you won’t be able to heal these emotional aspects of your experience. But as soon as you start walking that path, you will end up realizing more and more of what you are not. Because you are not those unconscious patterns of action. I am not the eating of food as I stand. I’m something much more than that, and the fact that I identify with it is just an expression of an avenue on which I can work on. That is the importance of the sadhana, because it opens up the space for transformation by showing you something different from the ordinary. How you react to what is different. And how you evolve your relationship with it. That is what the practice shows to you. May it be anything, but give yourself the permission to do it consistently. That is probably the word that I love the most in the world, because it speaks directly to my capacity of showing up. That is probably what I value the most of who I am, because I will be there. If I commit to something, I will make it, no matter what. That is the important thing. To be there. To show up.\n\nEach time that I write that I feel that I’m melting, because I’m opening for the universe to do its thing with me. It doesn’t matter where I’m taken, it just matters that it happens. For example, right now I don’t feel completely comfortable with what I’m writing. I feel that the way on which I have expressed myself is kind of dull and repetitive and not clear. There is an expectation for me to have kind of ‘more language’ to talk about this thing, and for me to be more ‘scholarly ready’. But the amazing thing is that 99% of the people in the world are not like that, so I’m directing my speech (or what I expect it to be) just to the 1% that is not listening to me because I’m not clear enough. What would happen if I directed it to the 99% with which I do have a conversation going on? How would that feel like to me? That sounds like an amazing experience and avenue for work. That is the message that I have been receiving more and more from all parts. Be simple. Stick to the simple aspect of your message, and that is where you will start having the success that you want. Be simple and clear, and things will happen. Just be simple and evolve with what comes. Iterate till there is enough people listening that you will end up being able to make your point across. Just be consistent with it. Just be clear. Consistency is what drives success in this moment in the world, and I have everything that I need inside for being that consistency. For embodying it. I just need to make the progress that I can with my heart in one hand as a sword of truth. What is my truth? Is my truth the one that the scholars talk about, or is it the one that normal people talk about? Who are the ones that I want to talk to? Who are the ones that will truly listen to me? Who are the ones that are most in need for help? That is the big question that I need to ask, and it is time for me to realize that the people that I will relate to are not the 1%. I have never done. They end up being boring. The ones that I care the most about are the ones that clean the floor, the ones that clean up the streets, the ones that are outside putting all their effort into develop a little bit more of dignity. That is where my message needs to point. For them to stop eating bread in the night. Instead of bread, just breathe. That is the new motto. Change the afternoon bread for breathing. Just for one week. See what happens. Don’t eat for one week, feel that hunger, and let yourself be transformed by that. Holy shit, I have so much willingness to help that I don’t know where to start. Maybe I’m overthinking it. Maybe I just need to start doing it. Go for it, practice with all of what I am, and just be. Go for it, and explore everything that I can be by helping my people to develop a healthier relationship with themselves. Change the TV, the news, for something different. Let me be that different thing. Every day. Consistently. With power. With strength. I tend to waste too much time thinking that it needs to be perfect, but it doesn’t. The only important aspect of it is that it is clear, so that people can follow from there. I have the best teachers of them all right here, right now. What if I start helping them become healthier and healthier every day? The ones that need more help are the poor and the old people, and that is part of the mission of what I’m creating here.\n\nBuild up experiences so that old people can gather and have the best time of their life. Is that even possible? Is that even something that will work? Would my grandmother want to go and enjoy some time with me? I don’t know. It is a big exploration. What is in her that she likes doing that I could do so that I could help bond my relationship with her? Which are the means by which I can help her with technology. That is something that brings a lot of willingness to help into my system. The wanting to help bridge the gap of technology and old people. Right now, they are kind of loosing the battle because there is so much that they could do, and they are not doing, because they don’t know how. That is something that could be amazing. Help my parents with their phone publicly. Teach them something new, every day, and with that bridge that gap. It doesn’t need to be something fancy, it just needs to be. That is the nice part. For people to know that I’m the one that will help them, and to start having that connection with them. It will be only two weeks until they start realizing that I exist, and I can accept questions from them and from then on I will never have problems generating content, because all of it would be a consequence of them asking questions. I just want to help. I have always wanted to help.\n\nI remember when I went travelling around the world, every time that I got to a new place I asked someone there to help me translate the basic stuff so that I could go around with my piece of paper asking people that basic stuff. And the number one on that list, always was: Do you need help? People usually learn how to say cheers in other language so that they can go drinking and have a good time, what I learned to say was ‘Do you need help?’. This is something that is very, very important for me to acknowledge, because it is the means by which I better comprehend that aspect of me that has always been present, and that the only thing it wants is to help. Do you need help? I just want to be in service, and by that become free from the burden of having to be someone specific. I just want to be in service, and help people become more of what they already are. Free up the space that is used by the frustration that comes from not being able to use technology in a proper way, and with that, help them use it at the highest capacity of the potential. That is a big aspect of bringing more creativity to the world, because a lot of that creativity is wasted with that friction that is generated between the tool and the person that is using the tool. I guess that it is a good moment to ask:\n\nWhich is the relationship between the tool (technology), the friction that is generated in the user because of the lack of experience on using the tool, and the creative process itself? This is a very important aspect of all of this process of becoming present. Because it you are using a particular tool and you don’t have the expertise to use it in a way that helps you do with it what you intend to do, what comes is the frustration of your experience not being something different, something that it ‘should’ be. You may say: ‘I should not be struggling this much, I’m going to stop’. And that is where the creative act stops. That is what I want to delay a little bit by giving the people the tools for realizing that it is a normal part of the process to not be able to use them properly. It is part of the learning curve, and the important part of it is not to give up. It is to realize where you are at, and acknowledge it.\n\nThe end of shoulds is about constantly reminding you the place where you are at, no matter with what, and realizing that everything is a path of exploration into what can be after you do it over and over again. That is something that keeps coming to myself, more and more. Because the frustration aspect is something that will always be there, there is no way around it, but there is a way around the necessity of it being different. And that way is the acceptance of where you are at. And by comparing you just to yourself you begin to better embody this acceptance. The only level of measurement of progress is you. Your experience. What you are able to do today, related to what you were able to do yesterday. Or maybe not even yesterday, maybe just a moment ago. The creative process is an exploration into the now, into the present moment. It is the means by which you anchor your self to the experience of what is going on in your domain of action right now, and the way on which you deepen that relationship is by developing a strong taste for the quality of what you do. Care about it. Realize that it is the aspect of yourself that makes you become more of who you are, and that there is nothing more important in the world than that. There is nothing more important than you could do than that exploration. In every moment. In every sense. The inquiry into who you are is the biggest quest of your lifetime, and it will never stop. Because it will never finish. It is an eternal unfolding that happens in front of your experience as a human being, moment by moment, action by action.\n\nAs I sit down here to Do The Work and just write, I open myself to discover which is the aspect of myself that is going to shine through my words. I open to the realization that there is something within me that wants to be expressed, and these words are the means by which it is expressed. It is magical, and it is eternal. As you live, you discover more of who you are, just by being a witness of what happens in your experience. You are life living itself through a human being, and every aspect of your experience is a demonstration of that. Open up to that wonder, and enjoy every aspect of it.\n\nThat is why old people are in my mind, because at least the ones with which I have a relationship have not had the capacity to express their creative being. And just as I write that I realize how full of bullshit I am, because I am imposing that belief system in them. How could I know? I was thinking about my grandmother not having a creative outlet, but then I watch out of the window and see the amazingly beautiful garden that she has. How can I say that she doesn’t have a creative outlet? Which one could be more amazing than that garden? I just need to take care of my experience, of the way on which I do things, of the things that I value, so that I can heal within myself. It is not my mission to help any other person to realize her dreams, it is my mission to do it for myself, and in that process, it will end up happening for others. But the most important thing that I could do for acknowledging the creative process of others is that: just doing it. That is the perfect aspect of it. Let them have their trip. Let each human being have their own trip, and sit down and just open up to be amazed by it. That is the best way on which I could possibly live my life. By realizing that each and every human being is having his own trip, and it is perfect like that. It shouldn’t be different, anything that should be different is a construct of my mind. Every time that the world should comes into being it is an aspect of mind that is willing to be expressed, and in that sense, it becomes noise. Free up from that noise, and open up to the possibility that the only thing that needs to happen is what is happening right here, right now, as it is. That is the only truth that will ever be. Embrace it, and realize that the only thing that I can do is just be myself. Just be. Just give my best to be present, and enjoy every aspect of what comes from that. Enjoy every breath, every deep breath that I’m able to put into my lungs, because that is the channel towards the now. The breath is the anchor of consciousness. Master your breath, master your life. That is the mantra.\n\nIt all boils down to remembering that you are breathing. That is the thing. Each time that you remember, breathe. Just notice it. Just do it. Just DAO it.\n\n--\n\nThe state of work is changing. The state of life is changing. The way on which we interact as human beings is changing. It is evolving. There is a much bigger capacity of connecting with those that are different from me through the internet, and that by itself enables a huge exploration into what is possible. By understanding that your beliefs are as valid as the ones of the other person. Open up to the wonders of what is built from that. Every person can teach you something. What comes of the other side of that?\n\nYou already are everything that you will ever be. That is the truth of the matter. There is nothing in your structure as a piece of reality that is missing from it. There is nothing that should be there so that you could be more of that which you already are. You are complete. You are everything, right now, as you read this, this moment. Don’t ever forget that. If there are any doubts, ask yourself: Who is the one that doubts? Where is that doubt present? Is it real? Is it permanent? Does it arise and go away? That is the game that you need to learn how to play, the one of recognizing that everything will come and go, naturally and permanently, and you are just part of that river on which life unfolds. Transform your experience into the perspective of the river, and open up to the evolution that comes from that.\n\nWhich are the means by which those realizations can be made mainstream? How can the gardener be able to move towards that understanding? Is it really my mission to do that? Perhaps my mission is just to give him my attention by being curious about his present experience as a human being. It is to use the power of who I am to bring him to the present moment, by embodying all of what he is by inquiring into that. It is something that comes up as an answer, but the funny thing about it is that I’m trying to answer that from a place of mind. How can consciousness realize itself through the eyes of another person if even from my own perspective I’m trying to do it from a place of mind? It won’t work like that. It won’t happen through this process. That is why the only thing that I have to care about it to embody that presence into each of my actions, in every moment, without a particular agenda.\n\nIf I go to him with the willingness to ‘wake him up’, that won’t happen, because in my actions there is an underlying shouldding, that is connected to the belief that he ‘should’ be awake. And remember that I’m talking about the end of should here, so this is something that needs to be pruned from the experience. It is not helpful, for any of us. Nope, it is just making noise. And it is time for the noise to stop, and let the calmness of the void to shine through that. Through the stillness that comes when the noise stops. The simplicity of it. Yes, the simplicity of everything that is left when there is nothing more left. And if I see him with a particular behavior that I judge as something that is not good for him, see where that thought is coming from. Who is the one that is judging? Who is the one that is erasing the possibility of empathy by trying to change something that is real? That has happened to me a lot these last days, trying to help people. Tring to show them what I perceive that they don’t see, instead of just being there for them. That is what they need from me the most. For me to be there for them. To share with them my whole presence, my whole being, just in a state of curiosity, of wonder, of awe, because of the journey that they have travelled to get to where they are at. I can’t expect him to be willing to educate himself, or to stop the noise, because that chatter is what keeps him alive. Maybe he is not ready to deal with all the emotional pain that is inside him because of what has happened throughout his life. Maybe it is just too much, and it is not my mission to deal with it. It is part of what is real right now, and the best thing that I can do is to acknowledge it and move from there to a better understanding of humanity, but just being curious about his own particular history. That is the game that I need to learn how to play. That is my mission here. To be there for people expressing their pain, to be there for all of what needs to come to come, and enjoy the ride. Enjoy whatever shines through, whatever is shown, because it is another aspect by which the universe becomes conscious of itself. Every experience, of every human being, is more of that exploration. It is not my mission to try to change it, it is my mission to acknowledge it as something fundamentally magical, as a miracle, and be able to move on from there. Every piece of pain, of hatred, of joy, of love, is a feeling that is true in the moment that it is felt, and in the moment on which my mind tells me that there is something that should be changed about that experience, the balance is lost. If I close the door to listening to that person and I open the one for sharing my own belief system and pain, I end up being egocentric. I end believing that what I have done is more important than what they have done, and that is the biggest fallacy of them all. It shouldn’t work like that, and in the future, as more and more people realize the importance of listening, we will evolve towards that. Step by step, over and over.\n\nThe human body is the means by which consciousness realizes itself, and the means for that to happen is in the acknowledging that each life experience through which consciousness has had an experience in this realm is equally valid, and it should have a space in the realm of all what is. The fact that I write that it should have a space speaks a lot about where I am at, because it is not that it should. The end of shoulds is the absolute realization that that space is already here. It contains each and every one of us, and it help us be complete in that. Yo be complete in the interaction with every human being, for it to be a miracle. A ritual. What if I engaged in anu interaction as a human being like if it was a ritual? Holy shit, I have a lot of homework to do. There is stuff that needs to happen here, and the perfect moment for it is now. There never was a better moment before. Realize how cool it is, and just be.\n\nThere goes the cliché again, and what I’m feeling right now is a strong sensation of being sleepy. There are a lot of things happening inside me, especially in the area where my brain is, and that area feels like it has a lot of samskaras that are being freed. And with that freedom comes the sensations of expansion, and also of a bit of anxiety. There is a deep sense within me that something very deep is unfolding, and I’m going through it right now, in these moments. It is getting more and more intense. Yesterday in the night I sat in meditation for a while and it was huge. It felt like that opening was reaching a tipping point (it has been like that for a while now, I think it is more than one year on which I have been saying that what I feel that day is the most intense thing that I have felt before, it just keeps progressing), and right now I feel that also. Something big is happening, and it is very hard for me to not associate that with the process of awakening. A big part of me tells me that I should not be attached to that concept because that attachment comes from the mind, but on the other side I can’t help but do it because it is what is happening. And if it is not what is happening I’m going to die, and it is ok like that. But there is something very weird going on inside my brain these days, and what I feel the most is this urge, or constant reminder, to just let go. Let go of the control of what should happen. Let go of the control from the techniques. Let go from the willingness for it to stop, because I can’t handle it. It is just what it is, and it shouldn’t be any different. I’m writing all of these words as a testament of what is happening, as a testament of what is going on, so that if something harmful happens to me you know about it. I’m here to take out whatever fear I may have inside by telling you that it is ok. I’m ok. It has always been ok. It may be something fundamentally transforming that which is going on, and it is ok. The pain is ok. The fear is ok. The anxiety is ok. The weird sensations are ok. The excitement is ok. The beer was ok. The joint was ok. The food was ok. Everything is ok. At the end of the day, it will all make sense, and when all the should are left behind, the purest expression of everything that I am will shine forth. Through. It will come as the deepest expression of what a human being can be when it just is. And there is no fluff about it. There is nothing special about me. I just did the work. I just sat down and stared at my own experience as a human being deepening the relationship with every aspect of myself in the process. Making the unconscious conscious. That is the game that I have been playing all this time, and that is what brings me to this place in this moment, being writing these words, this eternal rant of wanting to bring out what is going on in my experience so that I can leave space for what has always been there. This is everything that I have always been, and it is perfect like that. My experience shouldn’t have been any different from what it is. My parents shouldn’t have been different. My grandparents neither. My wife neither. My baby girl neither. They are all perfect as they are, and they are all part of this amazing symphony that is being played right now, in every moment, called life. Everything that I’m writing here is a call to action, it is the means by which I make every aspect of this experience sacred, so that we can together realize how incredible it is to be here. To have this opportunity. We are the consequence of a miracle that happened after a miracle. Each moment in the history of humanity has been a miracle that has built up towards this present moment, towards what is going on as I write these words, as you read them. You are reading them after I wrote them, and that is the perfect invitation to the realization that the present moment is everything that is, because we are both being transformed by the power of them in a timeless manner. It will be stuck in here, forever, and that is all that matters. That is the magical aspect of this whole existence. Time is a consequence of mind. What stays when the relationship with mind is evolved? A different notion of time. An eternal understanding that each moment is everything that is, and everything that will ever be. Now comes the means for bringing this into the world in a way that is conducing for us to relate to each other (and to the planet) in a way that brings the most amount of benefit for all of us, and that is how we are going to make progress. But what is progress, anyway?\n\nIt is what is being done, at every moment, by the actions of all of those who act. Of all of what is. Progress is not something that we can decide if it happens or not, it just does. That is the amazing part of the whole game, things just are. What is just is, and all the pages that have been written by this crazy human being are a calling into that. Pointers towards it. Towards the truth. Your own truth.\n\nI can’t find out what your truth is, because it is very deep hidden inside your system. I can only begin to realize which is mine by truly embodying the understanding that there are no shoulds in reality, and that everything is just as it is. What is your truth? Who is the one that perceives it?\n\nAsk yourself these questions until there are no doubts.\n\nThis is the pointer that needs to be brought up again and again. Question yourself, question everything that has been understood by yourself as real, and realize what remains as real. What is at the end of all of it? What is that which stays? Who is the one that stays?\n\nWe came here to just be. To explore. To witness. To embody. Everything that we are, through the particular lens of who we have been. Your experience as a human being is unique, and the mission that I have is to help you realize that so that you can bring more and more of it into the life of those who are next to you. To each person that you encounter, to each being that is in front of your domain of action. How will the world look like when there is a deep realization that we are all aspects of the same being? How do we relate to each other when there is an embodiment of the truth? Of each of our own truths? What comes at the other side of the acceptance of the truth of each of our own beings?\n\nWhat is your truth? Where does it come from?\n\nAsk yourself this question, over and over, until there is no doubt about it. If there is any doubt, go in there a little bit more. Step by step, becoming more and more conscious about what is just in front of you. Of this present moment. Of all the present moments that you will go through. Who are you right now? What is present in you right now? How does it feel to be you? Who is the one that is looking at his hands, feeling the touch of the skin, smelling the smell of what comes from your surroundings? Who is the one that listens? Who is the one that is connected to that array of perceptions that come from each one of those senses? Which is the limit of those senses? Where do they stop? Where do you stop? Where does the interface with which you interact with the world stop? Can you make it a little bit bigger? Can you dissolve the boundaries of that which you perceive as yourself and the environment? Is there any boundary at all? Where does the perception of this boundary come from? How does that inform who you are? Who are you? Who are you? Who is the one that is writing? Who is the one that is reading? Who is the reflection that comes as you look at your eyes across the mirror? Who is the one that smiles? Who is the one that feels joy with the smile of a little child? Who is the one that commands the action from each and every one of your limbs? Who is the one that learned how to walk? Did you learn how to listen? Did you learn how to taste? Did you learn how to see? Did you learn how to touch? Did you learn how to smell? Where does all of this come from? Who is the one that is behind all of those phenomena? Which is the canvas on which all of this painting is being displayed? Where is that canvas located? Is that you? When you read the word you, who is the one that is reading?\n\nInquiry into what is present deep inside you, and open up to the possibility that everything that you have thought that is true until now is just a mirage in the middle of the desert, which will always be playing you the fool because everything that you are is the desert itself, not only the one that is seeking for that mirage. You are the desert, the palms, the mirage and the seeker. You are what is left when the seeker is left behind. You are what is left when there is no you anymore. You are everything that is, everything that was, and everything that will ever be. Close your eyes and let that sink in.\n\nYou are everything that is, everything that was, and everything that will ever be.\n\nAnd you have always been that.\n\nYou just don’t know it yet.\n\nOr do you?\n\nThis is Dukkha, the maze of the mind wanting to go out of the mind by exploring each corner of the mind. The game of running around in an eternal circle, which is more and more of everything that you are not. This is Dukkha, an exploration into everything that is, by exploring everything that is not, by just making explicit and visible all of what comes. This is Dukkha, the game of emptying all what has ever been, so that from the ashes the phoenix can rise. This is Dukkha, an exploration into the wonders of life, into the consequences of showing up, of Doing The Work.\n\nThis is Dukkha. This is everything that I am. Everything that you are through my own experience. In the moment on which you start being, I am defined by that which you perceive about myself. The image that your mind builds up as a representation of what I am. What is left when all those images are left behind? What is left when the only thing that is there is the pure exploration into what is experienced together?\n\nWhat is left in you when the judgements about what you have been reading are left behind, and you open up to the pure possibility of just being?\n\nWhat is left in you when the whole notion of you is left?\n\nWhat is left when there is no left and right, and when there is no right or wrong?\n\nWhat is left when wrong and right are turned into a continuum, into the eternal exploration of the dissolution of polarities?\n\nWhat is left when there are no more judgements?\n\nWhat is left when all that is is just an exploration into what is left when the explorer ceases to exist?\n\nWhat is left, when fear is fully felt?\n\nWhat is left, when joy is fully felt?\n\nWhat is left, when anger is fully felt?\n\nWhat is left, when every emotion is fully felt?\n\nWhat is left, when you open up yourself to fully feel?\n\nBliss.\n\nThe pure consequence of our being. Bliss. All what is, in a dissolution of all what could be. Of what should be. Of what is not.\n\nBliss in the absolute acceptance of all what is.\n\nBliss in the recognition of the integrity of the present moment.\n\nIn the perfection of it.\n\nThis is all we have. All we have had. And all we will ever have.\n\nIt is time to embrace it. Embody it. And life from it.\n\nIt is time to live.\n\nIt is time to be.\n\nBe.\n\nIt is time to be.\n",

I finished my meditation primed for coming here to write and before that I realized that it would be a good idea to tweet so I started scrolling in there (not too much, just a little bit) and then I sent a gm message to my wife and there I was reading something that another friend sent me. It could be worse, I know, but it is part of what I acknowledge because if I just came here without having gone to the internet to consume before I would be fresher, with different ideas, and not blaming myself for not doing what I SHOULD be doing. There goes the magic word again. Thank you for coming back. I guess that it is a good moment for it to appear, because right now it speaks about why it is present. In my mind, there is an expectation of something that it would be good that it happened (that I meditate and come here to write so that I can follow that stream of consciousness without interruption of external stuff), and the fact that that expectation is not met makes me feel a bit out of balance. So what in the world tells me that that expectation is something good? Because of what happened, I\\u2019m here realizing what I\\u2019m realizing, and it is perfect as it is. It is not that it should have been different, it will never be as I expect it. Never. The important part of all this game is to realize that the game is to accept reality just as it is. Just as it is. If I stared at twitter for two hours not engaging with anything and just consuming what is there, it is perfect as it is. It is part of the game. It is part of what needs to happen so that I can better realize which are the aspects of myself that I need to work towards, so that I can better embody them.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"It happens with everything. My friend told me that she crossed the 1 month without alcohol mark, and that it has been brutal. I did not cross it, because for me there is not clarity on why I\\u2019m quitting it. I don\\u2019t feel comfortable with quitting really, because it gives me a space of connection with my family that is missing if this substance is not there. I have quitted for long times, but there is something that I would be missing if I quitted completely. And that is my mind playing tricks on me, playing its game of \\u2018ok, once in a while it is good\\u2019, and me not being able to realize if that is good or bad. There goes the shoulds again. The aspect of myself that writes that is the one that expects that there should be something happening with my relationship with alcohol, instead of what really happens. I should quit because it is what all the people that are healthy do. But there is a lot of things that I do and they don\\u2019t, and it is very important for me to realize and embody that I am a particular human being, doing his thing, with a particular lifestyle and activities and relationships and everything. It is part of the game. What I have learned the most out of this journey of self discovery is the importance of giving myself space to miss the mark of perfection. If I say that I will quit alcohol for 1 year, and I don\\u2019t do it, it is ok, I did it with intention. It was not something that I did just because I felt that I wanted to drink, I did it because I wanted to feel a deeper connection with my father. Did it really bring more connection with him? Actually not. They came to my house and it was me the one that proposed him to bring some beers, because of what I thought. But he ended up drinking a alcohol free beer, so all of my intention is in my own mind. What if I just invite him to have some tea instead of asking him to bring a beer?

Yesterday I listened to one that the person that said it said it was good, but I didn\\u2019t like it too much. He spoke about a pint of ice cream, that the first time you eat it all without even noticing. Next time you eat half of it. Next time you open it and realize that you don\\u2019t really want. And the next time you have the idea of having some ice cream and you realize that it is a thought and you look at it and it comes and goes away. And that is everything that it takes for making the unconscious conscious, to be able to realize how those thoughts come and go, and where do they come from. It is the same for me with food. Actually that thing that my friend has with alcohol, and she quitting it, I have it with food, especially sugar. Those are all regulators of the nervous system, and it is crazy to witness myself how I eat. I just open up the shelf and eat whatever I find, a handful of it, as I walk, as I move. It is very, very hard for me to sit down and eat my food. Enjoy it and taste it. It seems like every time that I eat I\\u2019m in a rush, there is something that needs to be made afterwards. And that is a killer of all the healthy habits that I could have, because of the information that I\\u2019m sending to my whole system related to one of the most important processes of my being: eating. I try to eat healthy foods, but the way on which I eat is not healthy at all. This is something that it is very important for me to take into account. My friend told me about alcohol being the means by which she suppressed a lot of emotions, and now that she is quitting it there is a lot that is coming out. It is the same for me with food, because I get to my house and I start doing stuff and I start running around and I get a handful of seeds before I take up Mila and I go and go and go and then my wife is talking to me and I\\u2019m chewing all this thing that I have inside the mouth and it is not helping me to feel good because there is that voice inside my head blaming me for being eating as I\\u2019m standing up and there is all the noise related to how I should be eating and I realize that I will not do it anymore but it is too late because I am already doing it so that\\u2019s when I say I will stop but it is almost impossible for me to stop because I do it so often that I don\\u2019t even realize, but that is the game, to start realizing it more and more often and because of that make it more conscious and develop a healthier relationship with the process of eating overall.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Make it sacred.

What I\\u2019m not willing to witness in myself and in the relationship that I have with my environment? Yesterday in the night I was eating as I felt a lack of love from my partner, and I thought to myself: I eat so that I can suppress what comes to me because of the lack of love that she expresses to me.

If I drink a beer every week with my father that is not a self-destructive behavior, but if a person eats pizza every day that definitely is one, so there is an aspect of the relationship that that person has with himself that needs attention. One take on this game is that the outer part of how we are built is the physical, then comes the mental, and then comes the emotional. Think of them as layers into your being, and how the outer layers manifest is a consequence of the internal ones. So if a person has problems in her body, it is because there is an underlying emotional problem that should be tapped so that the healing could be integral. Every part of it. We need to go deep into those emotional layers so that we can heal all of them, and with that, become free. That is what the samskaras are about in the meditation process. As you meditate, you start to feel certain sensations in your system that may be associated with a particular expression of something that could have happened to you, and as you just let it be and embrace it and accept it, it dissolves and it is integrated. That is the process with which you can start developing a healthy relationship with your own life, by being able to stare at those elements that are in you and accept them, just as they are.

But as soon as you start walking that path, you will end up realizing more and more of what you are not. Because you are not those unconscious patterns of action. I am not the eating of food as I stand. I\\u2019m something much more than that, and the fact that I identify with it is just an expression of an avenue on which I can work on. That is the importance of the sadhana, because it opens up the space for transformation by showing you something different from the ordinary. How you react to what is different. And how you evolve your relationship with it. That is what the practice shows to you. May it be anything, but give yourself the permission to do it consistently. That is probably the word that I love the most in the world, because it speaks directly to my capacity of showing up. That is probably what I value the most of who I am, because I will be there.

It is the means by which you anchor your self to the experience of what is going on in your domain of action right now, and the way on which you deepen that relationship is by developing a strong taste for the quality of what you do. Care about it. Realize that it is the aspect of yourself that makes you become more of who you are, and that there is nothing more important in the world than that. There is nothing more important than you could do than that exploration. In every moment. In every sense. The inquiry into who you are is the biggest quest of your lifetime, and it will never stop. Because it will never finish. It is an eternal unfolding that happens in front of your experience as a human being, moment by moment, action by action.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"As I sit down here to Do The Work and just write, I open myself to discover which is the aspect of myself that is going to shine through my words. I open to the realization that there is something within me that wants to be expressed, and these words are the means by which it is expressed. It is magical, and it is eternal. As you live, you discover more of who you are, just by being a witness of what happens in your experience. You are life living itself through a human being, and every aspect of your experience is a demonstration of that. Open up to that wonder, and enjoy every aspect of it.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"That is why old people are in my mind, because at least the ones with which I have a relationship have not had the capacity to express their creative being. And just as I write that I realize how full of bullshit I am, because I am imposing that belief system in them. How could I know? I was thinking about my grandmother not having a creative outlet, but then I watch out of the window and see the amazingly beautiful garden that she has. How can I say that she doesn\\u2019t have a creative outlet? Which one could be more amazing than that garden? I just need to take care of my experience, of the way on which I do things, of the things that I value, so that I can heal within myself. It is not my mission to help any other person to realize her dreams, it is my mission to do it for myself, and in that process, it will end up happening for others. But the most important thing that I could do for acknowledging the creative process of others is that: just doing it. That is the perfect aspect of it. Let them have their trip. Let each human being have their own trip, and sit down and just open up to be amazed by it. That is the best way on which I could possibly live my life. By realizing that each and every human being is having his own trip, and it is perfect like that. It shouldn\\u2019t be different, anything that should be different is a construct of my mind. Every time that the world should comes into being it is an aspect of mind that is willing to be expressed, and in that sense, it becomes noise. Free up from that noise, and open up to the possibility that the only thing that needs to happen is what is happening right here, right now, as it is. That is the only truth that will ever be. Embrace it, and realize that the only thing that I can do is just be myself. Just be. Just give my best to be present, and enjoy every aspect of what comes from that.

Is it permanent? Does it arise and go away? That is the game that you need to learn how to play, the one of recognizing that everything will come and go, naturally and permanently, and you are just part of that river on which life unfolds.

It is something that comes up as an answer, but the funny thing about it is that I\\u2019m trying to answer that from a place of mind.

Yes, the simplicity of everything that is left when there is nothing more left. And if I see him with a particular behavior that I judge as something that is not good for him, see where that thought is coming from. Who is the one that is judging? Who is the one that is erasing the possibility of empathy by trying to change something that is real? That has happened to me a lot these last days, trying to help people. Tring to show them what I perceive that they don\\u2019t see, instead of just being there for them. That is what they need from me the most. For me to be there for them. To share with them my whole presence, my whole being, just in a state of curiosity, of wonder, of awe, because of the journey that they have travelled to get to where they are at. I can\\u2019t expect him to be willing to educate himself, or to stop the noise, because that chatter is what keeps him alive. Maybe he is not ready to deal with all the emotional pain that is inside him because of what has happened throughout his life. Maybe it is just too much, and it is not my mission to deal with it. It is part of what is real right now, and the best thing that I can do is to acknowledge it and move from there to a better understanding of humanity, but just being curious about his own particular history. That is the game that I need to learn how to play. That is my mission here. To be there for people expressing their pain, to be there for all of what needs to come to come, and enjoy the ride. Enjoy whatever shines through, whatever is shown, because it is another aspect by which the universe becomes conscious of itself. Every experience, of every human being, is more of that exploration. It is not my mission to try to change it, it is my mission to acknowledge it as something fundamentally magical, as a miracle, and be able to move on from there. Every piece of pain, of hatred, of joy, of love, is a feeling that is true in the moment that it is felt, and in the moment on which my mind tells me that there is something that should be changed about that experience, the balance is lost. If I close the door to listening to that person and I open the one for sharing my own belief system and pain, I end up being egocentric. I end believing that what I have done is more important than what they have done, and that is the biggest fallacy of them all.

There are a lot of things happening inside me, especially in the area where my brain is, and that area feels like it has a lot of samskaras that are being freed. And with that freedom comes the sensations of expansion, and also of a bit of anxiety. There is a deep sense within me that something very deep is unfolding, and I\\u2019m going through it right now, in these moments. It is getting more and more intense. Yesterday in the night I sat in meditation for a while and it was huge. It felt like that opening was reaching a tipping point (it has been like that for a while now, I think it is more than one year on which I have been saying that what I feel that day is the most intense thing that I have felt before, it just keeps progressing), and right now I feel that also. Something big is happening, and it is very hard for me to not associate that with the process of awakening. A big part of me tells me that I should not be attached to that concept because that attachment comes from the mind, but on the other side I can\\u2019t help but do it because it is what is happening. And if it is not what is happening I\\u2019m going to die, and it is ok like that. But there is something very weird going on inside my brain these days, and what I feel the most is this urge, or constant reminder, to just let go. Let go of the control of what should happen. Let go of the control from the techniques. Let go from the willingness for it to stop, because I can\\u2019t handle it. It is just what it is, and it shouldn\\u2019t be any different. I\\u2019m writing all of these words as a testament of what is happening, as a testament of what is going on, so that if something harmful happens to me you know about it. I\\u2019m here to take out whatever fear I may have inside by telling you that it is ok. I\\u2019m ok. It has always been ok. It may be something fundamentally transforming that which is going on, and it is ok. The pain is ok. The fear is ok. The anxiety is ok. The weird sensations are ok. The excitement is ok. The beer was ok. The joint was ok. The food was ok. Everything is ok. At the end of the day, it will all make sense, and when all the should are left behind, the purest expression of everything that I am will shine forth. Through. It will come as the deepest expression of what a human being can be when it just is. And there is no fluff about it. There is nothing special about me. I just did the work. I just sat down and stared at my own experience as a human being deepening the relationship with every aspect of myself in the process. Making the unconscious conscious. That is the game that I have been playing all this time, and that is what brings me to this place in this moment, being writing these words, this eternal rant of wanting to bring out what is going on in my experience so that I can leave space for what has always been there. This is everything that I have always been, and it is perfect like that. My experience shouldn\\u2019t have been any different from what it is. My parents shouldn\\u2019t have been different. My grandparents neither. My wife neither. My baby girl neither. They are all perfect as they are, and they are all part of this amazing symphony that is being played right now, in every moment, called life. Everything that I\\u2019m writing here is a call to action, it is the means by which I make every aspect of this experience sacred, so that we can together realize how incredible it is to be here. To have this opportunity. We are the consequence of a miracle that happened after a miracle. Each moment in the history of humanity has been a miracle that has built up towards this present moment, towards what is going on as I write these words, as you read them. You are reading them after I wrote them, and that is the perfect invitation to the realization that the present moment is everything that is, because we are both being transformed by the power of them in a timeless manner. It will be stuck in here, forever, and that is all that matters. That is the magical aspect of this whole existence. Time is a consequence of mind. What stays when the relationship with mind is evolved? A different notion of time. An eternal understanding that each moment is everything that is, and everything that will ever be. Now comes the means for bringing this into the world in a way that is conducing for us to relate to each other (and to the planet) in a way that brings the most amount of benefit for all of us, and that is how we are going to make progress.

          "raw": "\nThis is one of those days after having done something that is not ‘good’ for me, that I “shouldn’t” do if I was serious about this thing (is that even something real?), but I just did it and it was very important to go through it. I smoked a lot of pot and went to the cinema, to see the latest superhero film that was available. When I arrived there I didn’t really know which film we were going to see, but it was that one and it is perfect. One of the most important things that I have realized the past years related to films is that -wait. I need to stop myself here and process a little bit not what I just already wrote, but where is it coming from. That aspect of myself that blames me for doing something specific is present here, it is present in the way on which I approach how I feel, and it is present in the way on which I started writing what I write. In this moment I acknowledge it, and I Do The Work of realizing that it is an integral part of the way on which I have behaved as a human being until now. Always judging myself and others because of what they do or don’t do, and this builds up a notion of separation that is helpful for no one. At least not for myself. I did it, I smoked all that pot, and it brought huge realizations for me. It helped me better connect with the person that my wife is, and with who I am in this whole adventure of being a human being. It helped me be a clearer witness of that which makes me feel separated, and I have the feeling that it brought a little bit more of the understanding of how to bond those separations into becoming integral. Always remember, with anyone that I encounter, meet them where they are at. This whole spiritual ego thing is very dangerous, because it can build up a notion of separation from the experience of another being just because of what has been done in life, and that is not helpful for me. It is important that I’m able to acknowledge that, and also acknowledge the place where I am at. Give up the bullshit, and just be there for every interaction that takes place in front of my domain of action. And the most important part about this whole thing is that in speaking about shoulds, I stop speaking about what actually happened, and I stop digesting what it brought to me. So each moment that I give energy to blame myself for something that already happened, is a moment on which I’m not able to give energy to build from there. To create. To invent stuff. And that is what I want to do, so I guess it is time to stop blaming myself and just let arise what comes after the experience of yesterday.-\n\nSo yes, we went to see this movie called Black Adam and it reminds me about something that I have been thinking a lot these last years which is the relationship that films have with the state of the art technology for producing them. The special effects in this movie were amazing, and having superheros that are connected to the real life is a huge avenue into the understanding of how to apply these effects in the scenario of the film itself. That is something truly amazing, because indeed yesterday the special effects were incredible. I can’t say that I completely followed the story and that I was able to really understand what was going on, but there is something very important present that it brought to me related to the word Adam. To that name. Historically it has been associated with the image of the first son of god, and in the film there is something related to this. He was the champion, the savior of his people, and the film ends with him being depicted as the one that starts a new way of being of his people. As I said before, I don’t recall completely how every aspect of the film went together, and I certainly don’t know how this fits with the big picture of what is going on, but it is always very interesting as a spotlight of where humanity is right now to go and see these kind of movies. They are the ones on which the studios spend the most amount of money creating them, and they are very popular among the general public. There is a huge aspect of how popular superheros are, and this is because of the story that each one of them has behind. The fact that we can go and relate to humans that were living 2500 years ago and those that live now, and that there are superhumans that are present in the whole story, is something that brings a lot. I will start to bring more of this into myself, because it is truly food for my soul. It brings me towards human nature.\n\nI feel that the idea of having a cinema is very connected to my heart, and it is a great way on which I can bring everything that I care about into the world. Yesterday I ended up realizing how far I am with my thoughts and what I care about from a normal human being, and this kind of instances could be the means for me to bring more of that into the world. I have been taking myself too seriously lately related to the impact that I want to have in the world and what I want to create in order to catalyze the process of awakening of humanity, but what if this is just related to creations? To set free the imagination of the world? Maybe that is what is needed. What was very present yesterday as I was watching the film was to create a chain of cinemas in every part of the world, but small ones. For the place where there isn’t something big. For places like mine. Now I realize that Puerto Varas resembles every other small city in the world, and that I can start creating something here for the people that live here, and from that, open up to the rest of what is outside. I remember this book that I shared with my brother, and in it the guy speaks about starting a chain of something, and how that chain could be started just in one place. That is the big thing, and that is what the infinite jest has been about all this time. It doesn’t need to be on a cinema, the cinema is the excuse. But what if the cinema was just a small store with the most amazing decoration, and that would be the showcase of what happened outside? And what happens outside is independent film creation. How long does a film take to be created? This is a big question, because it is the time that is needed until the project can truly start. I have loved this idea since the dawn of time, and it goes very much connected with The Infinite Jest. The film in David Foster Wallace’s book which was so entertaining that if you started watching it you died. But what if that dying is really transcending the human aspect of you are by realizing your true nature? What could The Infinite Jest be in this sense? A movie that is running 24/7 and that is related to all the amazing films that humans have created. That is something that is always in my heart, and having a place in downtown where that could happen is a dream of mine. And having a remote worker in each small city of the world that could use it as his office. That is all what it takes. It doesn’t need to be big, it just needs to be. This project has always been around myself, and as I went yesterday to the cinema it came with more strength. We are not used to watch movies because of our daughter, but nowadays people more and more spend their time watching series, which are an enormous elongation of time spent being entertained. What if that time was more focused, and with that, they could free up time for doing different stuff? For creating? For building? For imagining? For just playing? It is so hard for me to realize how to make progress, because one day I have one idea and the next one I have another one. It is crazy. But what came yesterday was the realization that yes, people need drugs for their mind to be opened. In my Twitter course they have talked a lot that as you build an audience you talk to your former self, who you were 1 or 2 years ago. Who was I in those moments? Every Friday night smoking a huge joint and then sitting down to watch the movie of the day. A movie that I didn’t know what it was. That is a huge part of the whole thing, the not knowing. For it just to start. That is the element of surprise that will make this whole thing successful. The minds of the people that go need to be bent all around, and the fact that they go and don’t know what movie they are going to see is perfect for this.\n\nWhat if there was a cinema that afterwards turned into a place where people could talk about what just happened? Another thing that came yesterday was related to specific topics of interest. For example, there could be videos of X topic played every Tuesday at the same time, and it would be something like a random person teaching something about a particular subject. There is a strong resonance in me related to how to interplay all the elements of modern society in this whole thing.\n\nWhat if I transform myself into the creator of film scripts and I write one every week and people build a film about it and in the film there are superheroes and those superheroes are then characters on Twitter? What if there was a movie character of black adam? I guess that that is the way on which AI is going to come more and more into our lives. By realizing the personality that different human beings have, or even ficticial characters, and being able to build up a persona of them on the internet which will interact with us as if they were real. Imagine there was a profile on twitter that was black adam. It would be the perfect marketing, and the perfect way of coming into the platform with hype so that people could interact with him. That is the perfect ghostwriting really. Putting yourself in the shoes of a character like this and doing the marketing for it on the background. This feels like a way on which the boundaries of what is possible are going to be dissolved.\n\nAnd what comes now is: How can I simplify what I’m talking about here so that I can bring it into the world? How is this whole process related to what I have been talking in this manifesto all these days. Am I a bit lost again? Is it time to do something to put myself back on track? Those are very valid questions, and if you are reading this you may be able to realize how much of a maze my mind is. It is crazy. Well, the mind is crazy, it is just that we don’t give it the place for it to be expressed. What is stored deep into the unconscious is very weird, and a big part of mine is coming through this writing. Each day that I sit down it gets weirder, and the understanding of this as the way on which to make progress gets blurry. But I’m doing progress. I’m creating something. I’m adding value to the world because I’m becoming more of myself through every one of these words. I decided that I would write a book, life has given me that opportunity, and this is me just doing it. Finding the joy in it, discovering the awe that comes from witnessing myself doing so different things. Last year these deep work sessions were absolutely focused on programming, and now they are on writing. What will they be in the future? What is the schema that runs through all of this? I don’t really know, but it is very interesting to witness it. The important thing is putting it out, so that people can know it exists.\n\nNo one really knows. No one truly knows what I’m going through. But that is true for each and every human being. It is not that I’m special because I’m going through the process of awakening. I feel special about it, because all of my being feels that it is a consequence of having ‘Done The Work’. I know myself better than 99% of the people because I have consciously done that. I have put myself in every position that I have found to know myself better. Is that even true? I haven’t worked in a job in an environment that is something that I don’t like. I haven’t truly exposed myself to the world. So is it true that I know myself more than 99% of the people? Maybe that is more and more of that bullshit that keeps running as noise telling me that I’m full of shit because I feel and think that I’m in a place different than those around me, and that I have to do something specific to put myself at the level of them. I need to do what they do so that I can become more connected to who they are. That is a pattern of action that has been present since I started drinking alcohol, where I felt that for resonating I needed to drink, so that I could become free of that voice and share my truth. But is it really my truth, or I am numbing something that I don’t want to see? That is the trick with alcohol and drugs. You end up not being able to go deeper, because you are comfortably numb. I was comfortably numb. And now I witness myself taking drugs and realizing, which is the aspect of them that makes me connect with them? I wonder where are the other people in terms of this whole awakening thing. Because I truly feel isolated, I truly feel alone. I don’t even know if it is something that should be talked about. For example, if I went to the house of my yoga teacher next week, would I ask him about waking up? I don’t feel comfortable with that, because there is this whole persona built around the spiritual aspect of wanting to be more spiritual. And where does that come from? I’m absolutely lost with this thing. Really. I keep running around the maze of my own mind, trying to get somewhere but not knowing where that somewhere is, and with an aspect of my mind telling me that that somewhere is just a mirage because there is nothing to be searched for because it is already here. As Dan said, it is closer than close. It is already present. And how can I move towards it? By not moving? By just doing?\n\nYesterday I wondered: How would an enlightened person feel if he got drunk? Or high? Or took some mdma? I wonder all of these things, because with the intense feelings and sensations that I have inside a big part of me thinks that there could be damage done. But how could I be damaged if I live a healthy life (?) and I take care more than 99% of the rest of the human beings who eat a lot of shit and don’t take care of their body at all? Do I really care about mine? What kind of sports have I done in the last week? Ahá! I’m beginning to uncover the BS in there. That is the magic of this game, to be able to unlock that BS and spot it. And witness it. And realize that it is not going away. It is just part of what is. And that is the process that I need to go through to be more conscious. Each time that there is a thought going on, stare at it, and realize that I’m not it. I am the one that smoked pot yesterday, and I enjoyed it a lot. Everything that came with it. But I’m not the one that now is blaming himself for having done it. Or that has these deep cravings for something that now is shining through: Being loved.\n\nThe fact that most of my aspects as a human being are ruled by the word ‘should’, is a message related to how much I care about what other people think. About fitting in their minds. And in my own. I have my own image of who I am, of what I do, of what I like, or what I don’t like, and I’m not able to break free from that image. I’m absolutely and completely identified with it. And it feels like the only way on which I’m going to be able to bring that into the earth is to go anon. To start sharing all of who I am from a place different from who I think I am. If I talk about myself as the name and character that I have been identified with all my life, it will be harder and harder to break free from the stuff. But if I open up the door for a new understanding, things will start happening from there. What is happening here is truly that I’m crafting the way on which I’m going to exist in the world. Yes. That much time I have available in my system. That is the huge necessity of control that I have. Holy shit, it is very crazy. Always controlling, everything. Always wanting thins to be in a particular way. But it doesn’t work like that. It can’t. It is just too much of a nightmare, of a prison, from which it is very necessary that I break free. And which is the path towards that breaking free? Becoming. Just being. Trusting. Opening up. Listening. It is not when I talk that I learn, it is when I listen. But I think that I’m very interesting, and that is why I love listening to my voice. There is a big aspect of myself that thinks that what I have to say is more important than what the rest has to say, and because of this, I keep doing the talk. I keep identifying with what I have to say as if it was the most important part of them all, not realizing that it is not. The important part is listening to others, it is to be there for them. That is what is very present in me right now, as I discover more and more of this whole thing. As I move more and more towards that place that is always moving with myself, getting further and further. Which are the mysteries of the universe? What lies out there? What is it that is being created through me? Which are the actions that I should be performing? There goes that nice word again. Should. Is there a moment in history on which you stop visiting me? I wonder. Am I the only human being that worries about this? Am I the only one that spends this much time debating with myself about the aspects of myself that should be different but realizing at the same time that each shouldding is a construct of my own mind and that it is ok to give it up and just continue to move forward with what wants to be expressed through me? What is that? What am I here for? Who are the ones that are waiting to be impacted by all of what I do?\n\nRight now I’m listening to Human Music, the radio that I created, and it is just amazing. Truly. The music that is in there is perfect, it is a selection of pieces that has brought a lot into my life, and it is very important for me to acknowledge that because of the journey that has been travelled. I created it and it adds a lot of value, it is just that people don’t know it yet. Because I haven’t been able to share it in a way that is compelling for people to go in and start using it. But in the moment that I do it, it will change the way on which a subset of people in the world exists, because it is just amazing. Simple, and amazing. The best. It will be important for me to reconfigure it again, to create the layout in a more modern way, so that it can be more appealing to people. They don’t come because there is nothing that reminds them that it exists. I have to have that in mind. I know it exists because I have created it, but it is not something that the other people have in mind. They just go with their thing, and do their thing. And it is also important to witness the workflow of people as they go in it. For example, if you click a link on instagram that takes you there, you will end up going in through the app, so the website will be open in Instagram, and that is a very bad UX. As all people have told me until now, I should create an app. Maybe it is time for me to work in it using react native, so that more and more people can have it installed in their phone. For it to be the place where they go and listen to music when there is nothing else. A true social media built around the sharing of amazing music. From random people. Crazy people from all around the world just sharing the music. Yes. There is nothing more important that I could create than this platform, so I will give it a bit more time.\n\nSo here I am, running around the maze again. Wondering and wondering about what this whole game is about. Yes. Yesterday there was a moment of realization that came to me related to what this is. It is the integration that I never had, for all of the experiences that I have gone through in my life. I have done so many different things, exploring in so many different realms, that I’m lost. There is too much inside me that needs to be integrated. That needs to be transformed into something powerful that makes me feel alive. And actually writing makes me feel alive. Creating makes me feel alive. Interacting with people makes me feel alive, because it is the means by which I’m able to condense everything that I have gone through into an exploration of the present moment. Yes. If I had to summarize the most important aspect of this whole manifesto it is creativity. It is that necessity of building up something that didn’t exist before, and more than building it, just exploring what comes up. That is the exploration. Witnessing what comes up.\n\n--\n\nBeing, just being. Just walking through the forest with the intention of experiencing what that moment brings. Writing, just writing. With the sole intention of bringing up the words that will end up making sentences. Breathing. Just breathing. With the sole intention to explore a little bit more into the wonders of life. Eating. Just eating. With the sole intention of feeling all the pleasure that is unleashed as each bite comes into the mouth. Wondering. Just wondering. What it feels to live a million lives. What it feels to be the other person. Caring. Just caring. To give a little bit more of what was given before. Loving. Just loving. Everything that is, as it is. Experiencing. Just experiencing. What every moment brings. The mystery of it all. Playing. Just playing. Inviting that inner child to shine through every one of my actions. Laughing. Just laughing. At the curiosity that is sparked by the laughter that comes from deep within. Becoming free. Just becoming free. From everything that should be in a particular way, and opening up to just what is.\n\nWhat is now is everything that will ever be.\n\n--\n\nThe act of creation is complete, as it unfolds in every moment, in every circumstance. It is as complete as it will always be, and in that sole recognition there is magic. The magic that comes from knowing that everything is right where it should be. Everything is complete, right here, right now, as I write these words, and as you read them. This moment is being in two different moments at the same time, and it will be there forever. What is present now will be present forever, and the impact that I make in the world by making it existent is everything that is. Everything that will ever be. I don’t need any more knowledge, I just need the doing. I don’t need to be part of more courses or groups or stuff, everything is out there for me to go and look for it. I just need to surround myself with the people that care enough for do their thing, and that is the way forward in this moment of history. Being able to discover who are the ones that matter, and connect with them from the heart. That is what is going to make the difference, that is what is going to open up the doors for a new understanding of how we relate to each other. It is time for me to free up the doors of wanting to do something different from what I’m doing, and to fully embody it. Fully transform myself into the act of creation that is being unfolded with each letter that I write. I don’t need to be anything different from what I am right now to do this. I don’t need the attention from the external world, because that would mean that in even in a small aspect I would be doing what I do to please someone. And I don’t want to create from that place. I just want to create from a place of truth, from a place of wanting to explore what already is, and be able to create something so valuable that people will afterwards share it with each other. That is the only measure of success, if I’m able to build something so valuable that it will actually be helpful for people, not just noise in their social media feed. That is a kind of noise that I don’t want, that is not helpful for me, and I don’t want it.\n\nWhat I’m doing here is an exploration into the long term, and it is very important for me to have that in mind as I sit down to Do The Work, every day. This manifesto that I’m writing is the foundation over which all my work will be built. Everything that I bring into the world will be in line with what will be written here, and it is time for me to realize that in order for that to be as solid as it can be I need to be able to put all my energy and heart into it. And that means taking care of myself in every aspect, so that I can show up. And if I don’t do it, it is perfect it is part of what needs to be acknowledged. There are no shoulds. This manifesto is the end of shoulds. It is time to wake up to how the world is and how it works, by opening up to be part of the flow of life. Be the best guest in this whole journey of discovery of consciousness by witnessing those amazing things that human beings have done until now. I know how to do it, and I know how to succeed. I have what it takes. And the biggest success of them all is just coming here and realizing that everything is perfect as it is. It is realizing that I’m already complete, and that I have already opened enough to the world. Patience, that everything will take its correct place soon. Patience is the biggest gift of them all, because it is what craftmanship is all about. Cultivate patience my friend. Step by step. Drop by drop. The drip work does its thing. If you show up, the world will answer back. I’m already showing up, it is time to acknowledge that and embrace it and live from that knowing, that I’m doing my best, in every moment. That is all what it takes. To be the best version of yourself that you can. Right here, right now.\n",

I smoked a lot of pot and went to the cinema, to see the latest superhero film that was available. When I arrived there I didn\\u2019t really know which film we were going to see, but it was that one and it is perfect. One of the most important things that I have realized the past years related to films is that -wait. I need to stop myself here and process a little bit not what I just already wrote, but where is it coming from. That aspect of myself that blames me for doing something specific is present here, it is present in the way on which I approach how I feel, and it is present in the way on which I started writing what I write. In this moment I acknowledge it, and I Do The Work of realizing that it is an integral part of the way on which I have behaved as a human being until now. Always judging myself and others because of what they do or don\\u2019t do, and this builds up a notion of separation that is helpful for no one. At least not for myself. I did it, I smoked all that pot, and it brought huge realizations for me. It helped me better connect with the person that my wife is, and with who I am in this whole adventure of being a human being. It helped me be a clearer witness of that which makes me feel separated, and I have the feeling that it brought a little bit more of the understanding of how to bond those separations into becoming integral. Always remember, with anyone that I encounter, meet them where they are at. This whole spiritual ego thing is very dangerous, because it can build up a notion of separation from the experience of another being just because of what has been done in life, and that is not helpful for me. It is important that I\\u2019m able to acknowledge that, and also acknowledge the place where I am at. Give up the bullshit, and just be there for every interaction that takes place in front of my domain of action. And the most important part about this whole thing is that in speaking about shoulds, I stop speaking about what actually happened, and I stop digesting what it brought to me. So each moment that I give energy to blame myself for something that already happened, is a moment on which I\\u2019m not able to give energy to build from there. To create. To invent stuff. And that is what I want to do, so I guess it is time to stop blaming myself and just let arise what comes after the experience of yesterday.-\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So yes, we went to see this movie called Black Adam and it reminds me about something that I have been thinking a lot these last years which is the relationship that films have with the state of the art technology for producing them. The special effects in this movie were amazing, and having superheros that are connected to the real life is a huge avenue into the understanding of how to apply these effects in the scenario of the film itself. That is something truly amazing, because indeed yesterday the special effects were incredible. I can\\u2019t say that I completely followed the story and that I was able to really understand what was going on, but there is something very important present that it brought to me related to the word Adam. To that name. Historically it has been associated with the image of the first son of god, and in the film there is something related to this. He was the champion, the savior of his people, and the film ends with him being depicted as the one that starts a new way of being of his people. As I said before, I don\\u2019t recall completely how every aspect of the film went together, and I certainly don\\u2019t know how this fits with the big picture of what is going on, but it is always very interesting as a spotlight of where humanity is right now to go and see these kind of movies. They are the ones on which the studios spend the most amount of money creating them, and they are very popular among the general public. There is a huge aspect of how popular superheros are, and this is because of the story that each one of them has behind. The fact that we can go and relate to humans that were living 2500 years ago and those that live now, and that there are superhumans that are present in the whole story, is something that brings a lot. I will start to bring more of this into myself, because it is truly food for my soul. It brings me towards human nature.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"I feel that the idea of having a cinema is very connected to my heart, and it is a great way on which I can bring everything that I care about into the world. Yesterday I ended up realizing how far I am with my thoughts and what I care about from a normal human being, and this kind of instances could be the means for me to bring more of that into the world. I have been taking myself too seriously lately related to the impact that I want to have in the world and what I want to create in order to catalyze the process of awakening of humanity, but what if this is just related to creations? To set free the imagination of the world? Maybe that is what is needed. What was very present yesterday as I was watching the film was to create a chain of cinemas in every part of the world, but small ones. For the place where there isn\\u2019t something big. For places like mine. Now I realize that Puerto Varas resembles every other small city in the world, and that I can start creating something here for the people that live here, and from that, open up to the rest of what is outside. I remember this book that I shared with my brother, and in it the guy speaks about starting a chain of something, and how that chain could be started just in one place. That is the big thing, and that is what the infinite jest has been about all this time. It doesn\\u2019t need to be on a cinema, the cinema is the excuse. But what if the cinema was just a small store with the most amazing decoration, and that would be the showcase of what happened outside? And what happens outside is independent film creation. How long does a film take to be created? This is a big question, because it is the time that is needed until the project can truly start. I have loved this idea since the dawn of time, and it goes very much connected with The Infinite Jest. The film in David Foster Wallace\\u2019s book which was so entertaining that if you started watching it you died. But what if that dying is really transcending the human aspect of you are by realizing your true nature? What could The Infinite Jest be in this sense? A movie that is running 24/7 and that is related to all the amazing films that humans have created. That is something that is always in my heart, and having a place in downtown where that could happen is a dream of mine. And having a remote worker in each small city of the world that could use it as his office. That is all what it takes. It doesn\\u2019t need to be big, it just needs to be. This project has always been around myself, and as I went yesterday to the cinema it came with more strength. We are not used to watch movies because of our daughter, but nowadays people more and more spend their time watching series, which are an enormous elongation of time spent being entertained. What if that time was more focused, and with that, they could free up time for doing different stuff? For creating? For building? For imagining? For just playing? It is so hard for me to realize how to make progress, because one day I have one idea and the next one I have another one. It is crazy.

I don\\u2019t feel comfortable with that, because there is this whole persona built around the spiritual aspect of wanting to be more spiritual. And where does that come from? I\\u2019m absolutely lost with this thing. Really. I keep running around the maze of my own mind, trying to get somewhere but not knowing where that somewhere is, and with an aspect of my mind telling me that that somewhere is just a mirage because there is nothing to be searched for because it is already here. As Dan said, it is closer than close. It is already present. And how can I move towards it? By not moving? By just doing?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yesterday I wondered: How would an enlightened person feel if he got drunk? Or high? Or took some mdma?

That is the magic of this game, to be able to unlock that BS and spot it. And witness it. And realize that it is not going away. It is just part of what is.

I am the one that smoked pot yesterday, and I enjoyed it a lot. Everything that came with it. But I\\u2019m not the one that now is blaming himself for having done it.

I\\u2019m absolutely and completely identified with it. And it feels like the only way on which I\\u2019m going to be able to bring that into the earth is to go anon. To start sharing all of who I am from a place different from who I think I am. If I talk about myself as the name and character that I have been identified with all my life, it will be harder and harder to break free from the stuff. But if I open up the door for a new understanding, things will start happening from there. What is happening here is truly that I\\u2019m crafting the way on which I\\u2019m going to exist in the world. Yes. That much time I have available in my system. That is the huge necessity of control that I have. Holy shit, it is very crazy. Always controlling, everything. Always wanting thins to be in a particular way. But it doesn\\u2019t work like that. It can\\u2019t. It is just too much of a nightmare, of a prison, from which it is very necessary that I break free. And which is the path towards that breaking free? Becoming. Just being. Trusting. Opening up. Listening. It is not when I talk that I learn, it is when I listen. But I think that I\\u2019m very interesting, and that is why I love listening to my voice. There is a big aspect of myself that thinks that what I have to say is more important than what the rest has to say, and because of this, I keep doing the talk. I keep identifying with what I have to say as if it was the most important part of them all, not realizing that it is not. The important part is listening to others, it is to be there for them. That is what is very present in me right now, as I discover more and more of this whole thing. As I move more and more towards that place that is always moving with myself, getting further and further. Which are the mysteries of the universe? What lies out there? What is it that is being created through me? Which are the actions that I should be performing? There goes that nice word again. Should. Is there a moment in history on which you stop visiting me? I wonder. Am I the only human being that worries about this? Am I the only one that spends this much time debating with myself about the aspects of myself that should be different but realizing at the same time that each shouldding is a construct of my own mind and that it is ok to give it up and just continue to move forward with what wants to be expressed through me?

I created it and it adds a lot of value, it is just that people don\\u2019t know it yet. Because I haven\\u2019t been able to share it in a way that is compelling for people to go in and start using it. But in the moment that I do it, it will change the way on which a subset of people in the world exists, because it is just amazing. Simple, and amazing. The best. It will be important for me to reconfigure it again, to create the layout in a more modern way, so that it can be more appealing to people. They don\\u2019t come because there is nothing that reminds them that it exists. I have to have that in mind. I know it exists because I have created it, but it is not something that the other people have in mind. They just go with their thing, and do their thing. And it is also important to witness the workflow of people as they go in it. For example, if you click a link on instagram that takes you there, you will end up going in through the app, so the website will be open in Instagram, and that is a very bad UX. As all people have told me until now, I should create an app. Maybe it is time for me to work in it using react native, so that more and more people can have it installed in their phone. For it to be the place where they go and listen to music when there is nothing else. A true social media built around the sharing of amazing music. From random people.

I have done so many different things, exploring in so many different realms, that I\\u2019m lost. There is too much inside me that needs to be integrated.

          "raw": "\nResting is an integral part of doing the work. That is the sentence that is running through my mind, as I come back here on this rainy Saturday to write to you what comes. Part of me feels that I should give space for not doing, but another aspect tells me that it can’t wait. There is a burning desire inside to keep doing it, to keep exploring, and that is what is present as I bring all of what I am into this equation and just show up, once again. It is hard to stop, when I’m the only one commanding. There is always this feeling of something that will be missed, words that won’t be said, feelings that won’t be felt. And there is not time to let them pass, they are eager to arise, and there is no time to wait.\n\nThe rain falls in the middle of a forest of very nice small trees, which remind me of a… Nope, they don’t remind me about anything. There seems to be a blankness inside, as if there was truly nothing to be said. Just the gratitude for people that are going through the same, for very nice people that were parents also a few days after I was, and empathy for how hard it has been. It is very hard, that is something that is not said enough. Maybe because our parents didn’t give themselves the permission for it to be hard, I don’t know. But I think that it is not said enough, how hard it is to be a parent. All the circumstances that are faced, all the crying, all the late nights up. All the willingness for them to just chill, and it not happening. Another place where the shouldding is present constantly, as there is more and more situations on which everything is supposedly in place but for them not.\n\nIt shows me how tough it is to be a human being. To come into this place out of nowhere, after being comfortable and warm inside the mother and then coming out and having to face everything that comes because of being at the other side. Teeth going out, a body that is under the most intense development of the whole lifetime, and who knows what else. I don’t even know, I don’t even remember how it was for me. It just was. It just is. It is part of what this whole game is about, and the nice thing now is to be in the house of a couple of friends that are going through the same. As I write this, I listen to their baby crying through the walls of the house, and I think about the frustration that they must feel, being woke up by that crying, once more, a new day. It starts again. In a big sense, having a baby is a constant reminder of the cyclical nature of life, of how similar one day can be with the next one, within their difference. Everything turns up into a routine, and in those simple aspects of life there is beauty, there is something to explore. Because what happens is that that highlights the new things, the new explorations that also come when you least expect them, and that at the end of the day are what make this whole adventure worth it. Because it is an adventure in and of itself, and I’m curious why it hasn’t showed up more in my writing all this time. It has been revolving around me, around my struggles with all this process that I think I’m going through, around me doing this or that, but I haven’t often talked about what it has meant to be a father.\n\nMaybe that is a big aspect of me that is important to integrate in some way, because it has been quite a ride. Yesterday I wrote about the integration process, and how this whole manifesto in a way is the means by which I integrate all what has happened in my life until now. Perhaps today is a day on which I move a little bit towards a deeper understanding of the process of parenthood, of being the male of the family, of having to take care. Are there judgements present related to the way on which it has been done? For sure.\n\nThe one that comes right now is my tendency to fall victim, and to not put myself in the shoes of what my wife is doing. And even more than that, my willingness to be ‘the savior’ in a way, to be the one that has the answers that make the situation better. Because I have travelled a particular path, there is something inside me wanting to be shouted out loud related to how things should be and they are not. There goes that mighty word again… How things should be and they are not. Expectations that are not being met, once more. Yes. Since the moment on which my daughter decided to come to the world there was a big aspect of separation inside me, because I was not able to be there for my wife when she most needed me. I felt bad because of what I was going through, but was not able to leave me aside so that I could be there for her. As the male that she needed, as the protector, as the companion that she needed in that moment. The day that we spend on labor at the hospital was an absolute nightmare, and I was destroyed. The thing is that I say that she needed me, but how could I have offered something different from what I was in that moment? It was also part of who I am.\n\nBut I did my best. I truly did my best. Oh, I remember now what I was going to say. I wrote before that I had the tools to navigate all that stuff and that it was frustrating for me not to be able to transfer them to my wife, I knew that she had to relax so that the birth could follow its natural progression, but it was something much deeper than that what was going on. And I was not there to hold her hand, because I on the root of my being I was hoping for things to be different. I could not believe what was going on, and in the most important moment of my life I was not able to deal with life as it was given to me. I could not accept it. And the consequences of it were a nightmare, probably the worst day of my life. So what does this tell me about having expectations and going with them? Is it even something that I should blame me for? I don’t really know, because we were not prepared for it.\n\nIt is not in my way of being, in my way of doing things, to step up strongly and fight for what is correct. In those moments we were helpless, having to trust people that we didn’t trust at all. Maybe that is one of the biggest components of doing something in a good way. Who am I going to trust? Where I’m going to deposit my trust so that it can be put at good use, so that it can bring something nice to all my surroundings? To the people that I care about?\n\nJust by listening to them. By being there for them. We ended up in that situation because I wanted it, I did not give my wife the space to tell me how she felt with the woman that was going to receive our daughter, and that was one of the root causes of what ended up happening. Once again, I was the one that wanted to be in control of the situation, that wanted to be right. Its crazy how much that is present in me, the wanting to be right. Maybe it is related to that trait of me that I discovered a few weeks ago, that is the necessity of being loved that is expressed by my tendency to be the one that makes the decisions. So that things can happen in the way I expect them to happen, so that they can have the impact that I expect them to have.\n\nI have a sense of disconnection from my writing today, even as I write about something as important as that day on which my daughter was born. Probably it is because Saturdays are days for resting, which is also an integral part of doing the work. I will come back to this in the future, to give it the time that it needs. So much to uncover from those days, that I don’t even know how and where to start. What comes now is the dream that I had the night before she started labor, and how I felt that whole morning. Sick, as if there was a deep purge going on inside me. Going through that dream, facing the deepest demons that my being had seen, and just meditating through them with the power of the mind. And then I felt how I felt, probably because of that. I was going to write ‘probably because I did not feel what they brought into my being’, but that is not true. I did feel everything, and the thing related to sitting down to meditate is that I allow myself to feel everything that comes. To be present with it. I did it, and it is important to acknowledge. All the process, of learning to be more present, so that I can be there when it matters. I’m doing my best, and it shouldn’t be any different from how it has been. It is all part of the learning process. It is all part of everything that just is.\n",

So that things can happen in the way I expect them to happen, so that they can have the impact that I expect them to have.\"}),`\n`,(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:\"I have a sense of disconnection from my writing today, even as I write about something as important as that day on which my daughter was born.

So much to uncover from those days, that I don\\u2019t even know how and where to start. What comes now is the dream that I had the night before she started labor, and how I felt that whole morning.

          "raw": "\nI had a dream yesterday. Quite a cool one.\n\nI was in the central square of the small town on which I live, and there was a gathering of people in a corner of it, one of those that call your attention and make you want to approach the group to be a witness of what they are curious about. I got there, and what had happened was that the biggest bank had been absolutely robbed, it had blown off from the inside, windows were broken, and there was smoke coming out of the window.\n\nIt had been completely destroyed, and people were there looking at what remained, taking about the level to which violence had grown, and how different things were from before.\n\nI went walking away, just pondering what I had seen, and suddenly I heard someone on my right yelling to the wind: ‘Twitter and blockchain are going to save the world!’. I approached the person to ask him more about what he just said, but he disappeared, and I woke up.\n\nIt is said that dreams are messages from the unconscious, and no wonder that this was another one of those. Those two technologies have been inside me a lot lately, on one side blockchain and the capabilities that it has related to being the means by which energy flows freely and without getting stuck in our society, and on the other side Tweeter, as the means by which each of us can have a voice on the internet, one that is fast, open and without censorship. It is the central square of the internet, where we gather to have conversations with each other, with people from all over the world, and the potential that it has after Elon Musk bought it is huge.\n\nI’m very excited about it.\n\nThe last month I have been part of a workshop on which we are working on understanding how to use the platform to build up an audience, a following, and a big aspect of myself has been a little bit uncomfortable with what needs to be done to get the respect of the algorithm that runs the whole thing. That is it: The algo. There is a lot of work done in the background for the whole system to work, it is incredible, but at the end of the day the most important thing related to the usage of the platform is the information that I’m shown when I go in there. What are the tweets that the application shows to me? Where will it point my attention towards? That is everything.\n\nIn this course I have been learning the things that I have to do so that I can please it and be shown to more people. That will earn for me a following, and that traction will start to compound over time. There are several aspects of what I ‘should do’ that are not comfortable to me, and that I see as important avenues for growth and betterment of the whole thing. This comes handy in this manifesto because Twitter is the place where a big number of communities start, it is where ‘things are happening’ on the internet, and it is the main means by which I will be able to reach out to people to see if they care to check out what I build. There are maybe better means which I’m not able to see right now, but at least now it is the one that makes more sense.\n\nAnd it has also been a huge part of my process of personal evolution this last months. What I write there is what I think, what I feel, and what comes from my heart. There is a huge opening that happens when I decide to share with the world my truth, who I am, and I have been going through the process of deeply better knowing myself by exploring my interaction with this platform. Who I decide to follow and how they make me feel. What is the content that I read and give my time to. How do I approach my writing and how I connect with other people. Which are the questions that I leave there in front of other people. Which is my bio, that is the window by which other people see me. Which is the profile picture that I will use so that people can recognize better who I am. I have spent a lot of time lately thinking (and iterating) over all these things, and they have been an integral part of my process of discovery of who I am. As I open to the world, I receive feedback from it, and that makes me grow into a more embodied version of myself. It has been a transformational process, for sure. The perfect companion for the process of transformation that I have gone through as an individual because of my practice.\n\nSo yes, Twitter has played a major role in this process, and I truly invite you to explore sharing yourself with the world in an authentic way. You can also be transformed by it. And there are plenty of social media platforms which you can use, it is part of the game to be able to discover which is the one that better suits your needs, but for me, it has been twitter. And yes, I will try to speak down here about the things that I think would make the whole experience better.\n\n1. Social media has always been about maximizing the amount of time that people spend in the platform, consuming content, so that they can sell more advertisement to the users. What if instead of maximizing this time they had another metric of success? Create something that avoids that tendency to ‘doom scroll’, and instead have the powerful content be displayed so that people can go to other places and read more extended articles. What if instead of ‘how much time I spend scrolling’ it was ‘how little time I spend scrolling’? The more valuable the content for you, the better. But that is the thing, people don’t truly know what is valuable, because their behavior ends up being managed by the spikes of dopamine. That’s why doom scrolling is so effective, because people really like doing it. It is the behavior of the 21st century. What if twitter opened up to change this? How could this be changed? Those are big questions, but the potential of twitter to be a place where we can connect with each other is huge.\n2. I really don’t like the fact that I have to be as consistent as I can be with the posting of content, so that the algo can favor me and put me in front of other people. I think it would be much healthier for society to have it categorize which content is relevant in a different way. If I have a great following and I stop tweeting, my account may die very soon, and that is very harmful for the mental sanity of the person that is in charge of the account. How can I go on vacation if I know that if I don’t tweet often my positioning in the platform will be very diminished?\n3. There is another thing related to the type of content that gets attention. Right now there is a lot of polarization, and all this different emotions that are catalyzed because of the use of this platform, and I wonder which is the way by which this can be transformed. Maybe it is because the algo pushes up the content that has a lot of comments, because it has more engagement, and that brings in more polarization. What is what comes after polarization? I think that it is unity, but it may be the naïve aspect of myself, which thinks that humanity is going to evolve. Maybe it doesn’t happen, and we stay like this forever.\n4. Twitter on the blockchain would be awesome. I imagine having everything that I said scripted in a block of stone and being available for me to see it in the future, and it feels amazing. I think that this would be an enhancer of how people behave, because of the social consequences that it could have to express a particular view in public, knowing that everyone, forever, will have access to it. It is interesting for me to think about this option, and I would vote for it.\n\nAs I write there are judgements present in me related to me not being too qualified to write about these things. But I’m just a normal user who has some ideas, who has done a few things, and has interacted with the platform quite a lot lately. I mean, not that much, but definitely more than what I would think of 3 years ago. I used to think that social media is the worst thing that has happened to humanity, but now I think the complete opposite. Social Media is the means by which we will evolve, because it is the place where we gather to build up the knowledge of the future. This used to happen in universities, where people would gather to have conversations around particular topics, but now it is on the internet. And Social Media are the entry points of the internet. They are the places where we gather, where we connect with each other, and where we discover who we are by interacting with people that care about the same stuff than we do. That is the magic of what they can do for us, to be that connection in the internet that is so much needed, and it is the place where we can find others. That is the thing. Finding others.\n\nDuring the whole pandemic, something that caught a lot my attention in a lot of events that I participated in was the repetition of the need of community. People need to feel that they are part of something bigger than themselves, it is a basic human need, and as we open to find others we end up creating those places for ourselves. All this technological tools are the means for that end, at the end of the day. We love to create and spend time together, it is more than important for our evolution, and social media is the place where that starts happening.\n\nThe impact that they have can’t be denied, and the fact that a major one like Twitter was bought by a person like Elon Musk gives a huge window of hope. Because it speaks about a change that can be made, that can start, as the willingness for it is in place from the people that make decisions. He is the richest person in the world, and he bought one of the main social media platforms to change the way how it works. This is huge. The impact that this has is not only related to Twitter itself, but to where the priorities of the world are shifting to. It is time to heal, and people are realizing that and there is active change being made for the betterment of humanity.\n\nI don’t have doubts about his intentions, I trust, and I want to be part of this change also. The fact that today I woke up with that dream is amazing, because it speaks to me about the stuff that I most care about. Where I’m walking to. It is very deep in my unconscious, this willingness to help, and finally I feel that I have found the means to do it in a practical way. In a way that can add value to the world, to other humans, and that feels good. I have always been stuck in the bottom of my rock, hiding from the world, and now it is time to get out of there and start exploring how it feels. How it looks out there. How can I use everything that I have gathered down there to guide others, to help them transition into a new way of being.\n\nTwitter is the means by which I learn to equalize my message so that I can communicate in a way that is complete. Until now, I have been just living in my own sphere, caring about my own stuff, and it is time for me to bring more of this to the mind of other people, and for that, I need to learn how to communicate effectively. This is only made by doing it, by exploring it, and this platform has been for me the perfect means for doing that.\n\nAnd related to the other part of the dream, blockchain, I feel it as the technology that will bring into the world freedom. Yes, freedom from all of those that have been put up in power because of something other than their own merits, and freedom from all of those that keep staying up there without doing what is necessary for it. Freedom from bureaucracies, freedom from waste of resources because of having to go through the stuff that is needed to cover your back. To save your ass in the future. But in the blockchain, this won’t happen, because everything that you do will be recorded in it. And it doesn’t matter if you work in there as an anon, because what matters is the interaction that you have with the platform itself. What it brings to you. What you bring to it. To the whole network. I feel very hopeful.\n",

          "raw": "\nThis is one of those days after having done something that is not ‘good’ for me, that I “shouldn’t” do if I was serious about this thing (is that even something real?), but I just did it and it was very important to go through it. I smoked a lot of pot and went to the cinema, to see the latest superhero film that was available. When I arrived there I didn’t really know which film we were going to see, but it was that one and it is perfect. One of the most important things that I have realized the past years related to films is that -wait. I need to stop myself here and process a little bit not what I just already wrote, but where is it coming from. That aspect of myself that blames me for doing something specific is present here, it is present in the way on which I approach how I feel, and it is present in the way on which I started writing what I write. In this moment I acknowledge it, and I Do The Work of realizing that it is an integral part of the way on which I have behaved as a human being until now. Always judging myself and others because of what they do or don’t do, and this builds up a notion of separation that is helpful for no one. At least not for myself. I did it, I smoked all that pot, and it brought huge realizations for me. It helped me better connect with the person that my wife is, and with who I am in this whole adventure of being a human being. It helped me be a clearer witness of that which makes me feel separated, and I have the feeling that it brought a little bit more of the understanding of how to bond those separations into becoming integral. Always remember, with anyone that I encounter, meet them where they are at. This whole spiritual ego thing is very dangerous, because it can build up a notion of separation from the experience of another being just because of what has been done in life, and that is not helpful for me. It is important that I’m able to acknowledge that, and also acknowledge the place where I am at. Give up the bullshit, and just be there for every interaction that takes place in front of my domain of action. And the most important part about this whole thing is that in speaking about shoulds, I stop speaking about what actually happened, and I stop digesting what it brought to me. So each moment that I give energy to blame myself for something that already happened, is a moment on which I’m not able to give energy to build from there. To create. To invent stuff. And that is what I want to do, so I guess it is time to stop blaming myself and just let arise what comes after the experience of yesterday.-\n\nSo yes, we went to see this movie called Black Adam and it reminds me about something that I have been thinking a lot these last years which is the relationship that films have with the state of the art technology for producing them. The special effects in this movie were amazing, and having superheros that are connected to the real life is a huge avenue into the understanding of how to apply these effects in the scenario of the film itself. That is something truly amazing, because indeed yesterday the special effects were incredible. I can’t say that I completely followed the story and that I was able to really understand what was going on, but there is something very important present that it brought to me related to the word Adam. To that name. Historically it has been associated with the image of the first son of god, and in the film there is something related to this. He was the champion, the savior of his people, and the film ends with him being depicted as the one that starts a new way of being of his people. As I said before, I don’t recall completely how every aspect of the film went together, and I certainly don’t know how this fits with the big picture of what is going on, but it is always very interesting as a spotlight of where humanity is right now to go and see these kind of movies. They are the ones on which the studios spend the most amount of money creating them, and they are very popular among the general public. There is a huge aspect of how popular superheros are, and this is because of the story that each one of them has behind. The fact that we can go and relate to humans that were living 2500 years ago and those that live now, and that there are superhumans that are present in the whole story, is something that brings a lot. I will start to bring more of this into myself, because it is truly food for my soul. It brings me towards human nature.\n\nI feel that the idea of having a cinema is very connected to my heart, and it is a great way on which I can bring everything that I care about into the world. Yesterday I ended up realizing how far I am with my thoughts and what I care about from a normal human being, and this kind of instances could be the means for me to bring more of that into the world. I have been taking myself too seriously lately related to the impact that I want to have in the world and what I want to create in order to catalyze the process of awakening of humanity, but what if this is just related to creations? To set free the imagination of the world? Maybe that is what is needed. What was very present yesterday as I was watching the film was to create a chain of cinemas in every part of the world, but small ones. For the place where there isn’t something big. For places like mine. Now I realize that Puerto Varas resembles every other small city in the world, and that I can start creating something here for the people that live here, and from that, open up to the rest of what is outside. I remember this book that I shared with my brother, and in it the guy speaks about starting a chain of something, and how that chain could be started just in one place. That is the big thing, and that is what the infinite jest has been about all this time. It doesn’t need to be on a cinema, the cinema is the excuse. But what if the cinema was just a small store with the most amazing decoration, and that would be the showcase of what happened outside? And what happens outside is independent film creation. How long does a film take to be created? This is a big question, because it is the time that is needed until the project can truly start. I have loved this idea since the dawn of time, and it goes very much connected with The Infinite Jest. The film in David Foster Wallace’s book which was so entertaining that if you started watching it you died. But what if that dying is really transcending the human aspect of you are by realizing your true nature? What could The Infinite Jest be in this sense? A movie that is running 24/7 and that is related to all the amazing films that humans have created. That is something that is always in my heart, and having a place in downtown where that could happen is a dream of mine. And having a remote worker in each small city of the world that could use it as his office. That is all what it takes. It doesn’t need to be big, it just needs to be. This project has always been around myself, and as I went yesterday to the cinema it came with more strength. We are not used to watch movies because of our daughter, but nowadays people more and more spend their time watching series, which are an enormous elongation of time spent being entertained. What if that time was more focused, and with that, they could free up time for doing different stuff? For creating? For building? For imagining? For just playing? It is so hard for me to realize how to make progress, because one day I have one idea and the next one I have another one. It is crazy. But what came yesterday was the realization that yes, people need drugs for their mind to be opened. In my Twitter course they have talked a lot that as you build an audience you talk to your former self, who you were 1 or 2 years ago. Who was I in those moments? Every Friday night smoking a huge joint and then sitting down to watch the movie of the day. A movie that I didn’t know what it was. That is a huge part of the whole thing, the not knowing. For it just to start. That is the element of surprise that will make this whole thing successful. The minds of the people that go need to be bent all around, and the fact that they go and don’t know what movie they are going to see is perfect for this.\n\nWhat if there was a cinema that afterwards turned into a place where people could talk about what just happened? Another thing that came yesterday was related to specific topics of interest. For example, there could be videos of X topic played every Tuesday at the same time, and it would be something like a random person teaching something about a particular subject. There is a strong resonance in me related to how to interplay all the elements of modern society in this whole thing.\n\nWhat if I transform myself into the creator of film scripts and I write one every week and people build a film about it and in the film there are superheroes and those superheroes are then characters on Twitter? What if there was a movie character of black adam? I guess that that is the way on which AI is going to come more and more into our lives. By realizing the personality that different human beings have, or even ficticial characters, and being able to build up a persona of them on the internet which will interact with us as if they were real. Imagine there was a profile on twitter that was black adam. It would be the perfect marketing, and the perfect way of coming into the platform with hype so that people could interact with him. That is the perfect ghostwriting really. Putting yourself in the shoes of a character like this and doing the marketing for it on the background. This feels like a way on which the boundaries of what is possible are going to be dissolved.\n\nAnd what comes now is: How can I simplify what I’m talking about here so that I can bring it into the world? How is this whole process related to what I have been talking in this manifesto all these days. Am I a bit lost again? Is it time to do something to put myself back on track? Those are very valid questions, and if you are reading this you may be able to realize how much of a maze my mind is. It is crazy. Well, the mind is crazy, it is just that we don’t give it the place for it to be expressed. What is stored deep into the unconscious is very weird, and a big part of mine is coming through this writing. Each day that I sit down it gets weirder, and the understanding of this as the way on which to make progress gets blurry. But I’m doing progress. I’m creating something. I’m adding value to the world because I’m becoming more of myself through every one of these words. I decided that I would write a book, life has given me that opportunity, and this is me just doing it. Finding the joy in it, discovering the awe that comes from witnessing myself doing so different things. Last year these deep work sessions were absolutely focused on programming, and now they are on writing. What will they be in the future? What is the schema that runs through all of this? I don’t really know, but it is very interesting to witness it. The important thing is putting it out, so that people can know it exists.\n\nNo one really knows. No one truly knows what I’m going through. But that is true for each and every human being. It is not that I’m special because I’m going through the process of awakening. I feel special about it, because all of my being feels that it is a consequence of having ‘Done The Work’. I know myself better than 99% of the people because I have consciously done that. I have put myself in every position that I have found to know myself better. Is that even true? I haven’t worked in a job in an environment that is something that I don’t like. I haven’t truly exposed myself to the world. So is it true that I know myself more than 99% of the people? Maybe that is more and more of that bullshit that keeps running as noise telling me that I’m full of shit because I feel and think that I’m in a place different than those around me, and that I have to do something specific to put myself at the level of them. I need to do what they do so that I can become more connected to who they are. That is a pattern of action that has been present since I started drinking alcohol, where I felt that for resonating I needed to drink, so that I could become free of that voice and share my truth. But is it really my truth, or I am numbing something that I don’t want to see? That is the trick with alcohol and drugs. You end up not being able to go deeper, because you are comfortably numb. I was comfortably numb. And now I witness myself taking drugs and realizing, which is the aspect of them that makes me connect with them? I wonder where are the other people in terms of this whole awakening thing. Because I truly feel isolated, I truly feel alone. I don’t even know if it is something that should be talked about. For example, if I went to the house of my yoga teacher next week, would I ask him about waking up? I don’t feel comfortable with that, because there is this whole persona built around the spiritual aspect of wanting to be more spiritual. And where does that come from? I’m absolutely lost with this thing. Really. I keep running around the maze of my own mind, trying to get somewhere but not knowing where that somewhere is, and with an aspect of my mind telling me that that somewhere is just a mirage because there is nothing to be searched for because it is already here. As Dan said, it is closer than close. It is already present. And how can I move towards it? By not moving? By just doing?\n\nYesterday I wondered: How would an enlightened person feel if he got drunk? Or high? Or took some mdma? I wonder all of these things, because with the intense feelings and sensations that I have inside a big part of me thinks that there could be damage done. But how could I be damaged if I live a healthy life (?) and I take care more than 99% of the rest of the human beings who eat a lot of shit and don’t take care of their body at all? Do I really care about mine? What kind of sports have I done in the last week? Ahá! I’m beginning to uncover the BS in there. That is the magic of this game, to be able to unlock that BS and spot it. And witness it. And realize that it is not going away. It is just part of what is. And that is the process that I need to go through to be more conscious. Each time that there is a thought going on, stare at it, and realize that I’m not it. I am the one that smoked pot yesterday, and I enjoyed it a lot. Everything that came with it. But I’m not the one that now is blaming himself for having done it. Or that has these deep cravings for something that now is shining through: Being loved.\n\nThe fact that most of my aspects as a human being are ruled by the word ‘should’, is a message related to how much I care about what other people think. About fitting in their minds. And in my own. I have my own image of who I am, of what I do, of what I like, or what I don’t like, and I’m not able to break free from that image. I’m absolutely and completely identified with it. And it feels like the only way on which I’m going to be able to bring that into the earth is to go anon. To start sharing all of who I am from a place different from who I think I am. If I talk about myself as the name and character that I have been identified with all my life, it will be harder and harder to break free from the stuff. But if I open up the door for a new understanding, things will start happening from there. What is happening here is truly that I’m crafting the way on which I’m going to exist in the world. Yes. That much time I have available in my system. That is the huge necessity of control that I have. Holy shit, it is very crazy. Always controlling, everything. Always wanting thins to be in a particular way. But it doesn’t work like that. It can’t. It is just too much of a nightmare, of a prison, from which it is very necessary that I break free. And which is the path towards that breaking free? Becoming. Just being. Trusting. Opening up. Listening. It is not when I talk that I learn, it is when I listen. But I think that I’m very interesting, and that is why I love listening to my voice. There is a big aspect of myself that thinks that what I have to say is more important than what the rest has to say, and because of this, I keep doing the talk. I keep identifying with what I have to say as if it was the most important part of them all, not realizing that it is not. The important part is listening to others, it is to be there for them. That is what is very present in me right now, as I discover more and more of this whole thing. As I move more and more towards that place that is always moving with myself, getting further and further. Which are the mysteries of the universe? What lies out there? What is it that is being created through me? Which are the actions that I should be performing? There goes that nice word again. Should. Is there a moment in history on which you stop visiting me? I wonder. Am I the only human being that worries about this? Am I the only one that spends this much time debating with myself about the aspects of myself that should be different but realizing at the same time that each shouldding is a construct of my own mind and that it is ok to give it up and just continue to move forward with what wants to be expressed through me? What is that? What am I here for? Who are the ones that are waiting to be impacted by all of what I do?\n\nRight now I’m listening to Human Music, the radio that I created, and it is just amazing. Truly. The music that is in there is perfect, it is a selection of pieces that has brought a lot into my life, and it is very important for me to acknowledge that because of the journey that has been travelled. I created it and it adds a lot of value, it is just that people don’t know it yet. Because I haven’t been able to share it in a way that is compelling for people to go in and start using it. But in the moment that I do it, it will change the way on which a subset of people in the world exists, because it is just amazing. Simple, and amazing. The best. It will be important for me to reconfigure it again, to create the layout in a more modern way, so that it can be more appealing to people. They don’t come because there is nothing that reminds them that it exists. I have to have that in mind. I know it exists because I have created it, but it is not something that the other people have in mind. They just go with their thing, and do their thing. And it is also important to witness the workflow of people as they go in it. For example, if you click a link on instagram that takes you there, you will end up going in through the app, so the website will be open in Instagram, and that is a very bad UX. As all people have told me until now, I should create an app. Maybe it is time for me to work in it using react native, so that more and more people can have it installed in their phone. For it to be the place where they go and listen to music when there is nothing else. A true social media built around the sharing of amazing music. From random people. Crazy people from all around the world just sharing the music. Yes. There is nothing more important that I could create than this platform, so I will give it a bit more time.\n\nSo here I am, running around the maze again. Wondering and wondering about what this whole game is about. Yes. Yesterday there was a moment of realization that came to me related to what this is. It is the integration that I never had, for all of the experiences that I have gone through in my life. I have done so many different things, exploring in so many different realms, that I’m lost. There is too much inside me that needs to be integrated. That needs to be transformed into something powerful that makes me feel alive. And actually writing makes me feel alive. Creating makes me feel alive. Interacting with people makes me feel alive, because it is the means by which I’m able to condense everything that I have gone through into an exploration of the present moment. Yes. If I had to summarize the most important aspect of this whole manifesto it is creativity. It is that necessity of building up something that didn’t exist before, and more than building it, just exploring what comes up. That is the exploration. Witnessing what comes up.\n\n--\n\nBeing, just being. Just walking through the forest with the intention of experiencing what that moment brings. Writing, just writing. With the sole intention of bringing up the words that will end up making sentences. Breathing. Just breathing. With the sole intention to explore a little bit more into the wonders of life. Eating. Just eating. With the sole intention of feeling all the pleasure that is unleashed as each bite comes into the mouth. Wondering. Just wondering. What it feels to live a million lives. What it feels to be the other person. Caring. Just caring. To give a little bit more of what was given before. Loving. Just loving. Everything that is, as it is. Experiencing. Just experiencing. What every moment brings. The mystery of it all. Playing. Just playing. Inviting that inner child to shine through every one of my actions. Laughing. Just laughing. At the curiosity that is sparked by the laughter that comes from deep within. Becoming free. Just becoming free. From everything that should be in a particular way, and opening up to just what is.\n\nWhat is now is everything that will ever be.\n\n--\n\nThe act of creation is complete, as it unfolds in every moment, in every circumstance. It is as complete as it will always be, and in that sole recognition there is magic. The magic that comes from knowing that everything is right where it should be. Everything is complete, right here, right now, as I write these words, and as you read them. This moment is being in two different moments at the same time, and it will be there forever. What is present now will be present forever, and the impact that I make in the world by making it existent is everything that is. Everything that will ever be. I don’t need any more knowledge, I just need the doing. I don’t need to be part of more courses or groups or stuff, everything is out there for me to go and look for it. I just need to surround myself with the people that care enough for do their thing, and that is the way forward in this moment of history. Being able to discover who are the ones that matter, and connect with them from the heart. That is what is going to make the difference, that is what is going to open up the doors for a new understanding of how we relate to each other. It is time for me to free up the doors of wanting to do something different from what I’m doing, and to fully embody it. Fully transform myself into the act of creation that is being unfolded with each letter that I write. I don’t need to be anything different from what I am right now to do this. I don’t need the attention from the external world, because that would mean that in even in a small aspect I would be doing what I do to please someone. And I don’t want to create from that place. I just want to create from a place of truth, from a place of wanting to explore what already is, and be able to create something so valuable that people will afterwards share it with each other. That is the only measure of success, if I’m able to build something so valuable that it will actually be helpful for people, not just noise in their social media feed. That is a kind of noise that I don’t want, that is not helpful for me, and I don’t want it.\n\nWhat I’m doing here is an exploration into the long term, and it is very important for me to have that in mind as I sit down to Do The Work, every day. This manifesto that I’m writing is the foundation over which all my work will be built. Everything that I bring into the world will be in line with what will be written here, and it is time for me to realize that in order for that to be as solid as it can be I need to be able to put all my energy and heart into it. And that means taking care of myself in every aspect, so that I can show up. And if I don’t do it, it is perfect it is part of what needs to be acknowledged. There are no shoulds. This manifesto is the end of shoulds. It is time to wake up to how the world is and how it works, by opening up to be part of the flow of life. Be the best guest in this whole journey of discovery of consciousness by witnessing those amazing things that human beings have done until now. I know how to do it, and I know how to succeed. I have what it takes. And the biggest success of them all is just coming here and realizing that everything is perfect as it is. It is realizing that I’m already complete, and that I have already opened enough to the world. Patience, that everything will take its correct place soon. Patience is the biggest gift of them all, because it is what craftmanship is all about. Cultivate patience my friend. Step by step. Drop by drop. The drip work does its thing. If you show up, the world will answer back. I’m already showing up, it is time to acknowledge that and embrace it and live from that knowing, that I’m doing my best, in every moment. That is all what it takes. To be the best version of yourself that you can. Right here, right now.\n",

So each moment that I give energy to blame myself for something that already happened, is a moment on which I\\u2019m not able to give energy to build from there. To create. To invent stuff. And that is what I want to do, so I guess it is time to stop blaming myself and just let arise what comes after the experience of yesterday.-\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So yes, we went to see this movie called Black Adam and it reminds me about something that I have been thinking a lot these last years which is the relationship that films have with the state of the art technology for producing them. The special effects in this movie were amazing, and having superheros that are connected to the real life is a huge avenue into the understanding of how to apply these effects in the scenario of the film itself. That is something truly amazing, because indeed yesterday the special effects were incredible. I can\\u2019t say that I completely followed the story and that I was able to really understand what was going on, but there is something very important present that it brought to me related to the word Adam. To that name. Historically it has been associated with the image of the first son of god, and in the film there is something related to this. He was the champion, the savior of his people, and the film ends with him being depicted as the one that starts a new way of being of his people. As I said before, I don\\u2019t recall completely how every aspect of the film went together, and I certainly don\\u2019t know how this fits with the big picture of what is going on, but it is always very interesting as a spotlight of where humanity is right now to go and see these kind of movies. They are the ones on which the studios spend the most amount of money creating them, and they are very popular among the general public. There is a huge aspect of how popular superheros are, and this is because of the story that each one of them has behind. The fact that we can go and relate to humans that were living 2500 years ago and those that live now, and that there are superhumans that are present in the whole story, is something that brings a lot. I will start to bring more of this into myself, because it is truly food for my soul. It brings me towards human nature.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"I feel that the idea of having a cinema is very connected to my heart, and it is a great way on which I can bring everything that I care about into the world. Yesterday I ended up realizing how far I am with my thoughts and what I care about from a normal human being, and this kind of instances could be the means for me to bring more of that into the world. I have been taking myself too seriously lately related to the impact that I want to have in the world and what I want to create in order to catalyze the process of awakening of humanity, but what if this is just related to creations? To set free the imagination of the world? Maybe that is what is needed. What was very present yesterday as I was watching the film was to create a chain of cinemas in every part of the world, but small ones. For the place where there isn\\u2019t something big. For places like mine. Now I realize that Puerto Varas resembles every other small city in the world, and that I can start creating something here for the people that live here, and from that, open up to the rest of what is outside. I remember this book that I shared with my brother, and in it the guy speaks about starting a chain of something, and how that chain could be started just in one place. That is the big thing, and that is what the infinite jest has been about all this time. It doesn\\u2019t need to be on a cinema, the cinema is the excuse. But what if the cinema was just a small store with the most amazing decoration, and that would be the showcase of what happened outside? And what happens outside is independent film creation. How long does a film take to be created? This is a big question, because it is the time that is needed until the project can truly start. I have loved this idea since the dawn of time, and it goes very much connected with The Infinite Jest. The film in David Foster Wallace\\u2019s book which was so entertaining that if you started watching it you died. But what if that dying is really transcending the human aspect of you are by realizing your true nature? What could The Infinite Jest be in this sense? A movie that is running 24/7 and that is related to all the amazing films that humans have created. That is something that is always in my heart, and having a place in downtown where that could happen is a dream of mine. And having a remote worker in each small city of the world that could use it as his office. That is all what it takes. It doesn\\u2019t need to be big, it just needs to be. This project has always been around myself, and as I went yesterday to the cinema it came with more strength. We are not used to watch movies because of our daughter, but nowadays people more and more spend their time watching series, which are an enormous elongation of time spent being entertained. What if that time was more focused, and with that, they could free up time for doing different stuff? For creating? For building? For imagining? For just playing? It is so hard for me to realize how to make progress, because one day I have one idea and the next one I have another one. It is crazy. But what came yesterday was the realization that yes, people need drugs for their mind to be opened. In my Twitter course they have talked a lot that as you build an audience you talk to your former self, who you were 1 or 2 years ago. Who was I in those moments? Every Friday night smoking a huge joint and then sitting down to watch the movie of the day. A movie that I didn\\u2019t know what it was. That is a huge part of the whole thing, the not knowing. For it just to start. That is the element of surprise that will make this whole thing successful. The minds of the people that go need to be bent all around, and the fact that they go and don\\u2019t know what movie they are going to see is perfect for this.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"What if there was a cinema that afterwards turned into a place where people could talk about what just happened? Another thing that came yesterday was related to specific topics of interest. For example, there could be videos of X topic played every Tuesday at the same time, and it would be something like a random person teaching something about a particular subject. There is a strong resonance in me related to how to interplay all the elements of modern society in this whole thing.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"What if I transform myself into the creator of film scripts and I write one every week and people build a film about it and in the film there are superheroes and those superheroes are then characters on Twitter? What if there was a movie character of black adam? I guess that that is the way on which AI is going to come more and more into our lives. By realizing the personality that different human beings have, or even ficticial characters, and being able to build up a persona of them on the internet which will interact with us as if they were real. Imagine there was a profile on twitter that was black adam. It would be the perfect marketing, and the perfect way of coming into the platform with hype so that people could interact with him. That is the perfect ghostwriting really. Putting yourself in the shoes of a character like this and doing the marketing for it on the background. This feels like a way on which the boundaries of what is possible are going to be dissolved.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And what comes now is: How can I simplify what I\\u2019m talking about here so that I can bring it into the world? How is this whole process related to what I have been talking in this manifesto all these days. Am I a bit lost again? Is it time to do something to put myself back on track? Those are very valid questions, and if you are reading this you may be able to realize how much of a maze my mind is. It is crazy. Well, the mind is crazy, it is just that we don\\u2019t give it the place for it to be expressed. What is stored deep into the unconscious is very weird, and a big part of mine is coming through this writing. Each day that I sit down it gets weirder, and the understanding of this as the way on which to make progress gets blurry. But I\\u2019m doing progress. I\\u2019m creating something. I\\u2019m adding value to the world because I\\u2019m becoming more of myself through every one of these words. I decided that I would write a book, life has given me that opportunity, and this is me just doing it. Finding the joy in it, discovering the awe that comes from witnessing myself doing so different things. Last year these deep work sessions were absolutely focused on programming, and now they are on writing. What will they be in the future? What is the schema that runs through all of this? I don\\u2019t really know, but it is very interesting to witness it. The important thing is putting it out, so that people can know it exists.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"No one really knows. No one truly knows what I\\u2019m going through. But that is true for each and every human being. It is not that I\\u2019m special because I\\u2019m going through the process of awakening. I feel special about it, because all of my being feels that it is a consequence of having \\u2018Done The Work\\u2019. I know myself better than 99% of the people because I have consciously done that. I have put myself in every position that I have found to know myself better. Is that even true? I haven\\u2019t worked in a job in an environment that is something that I don\\u2019t like. I haven\\u2019t truly exposed myself to the world. So is it true that I know myself more than 99% of the people? Maybe that is more and more of that bullshit that keeps running as noise telling me that I\\u2019m full of shit because I feel and think that I\\u2019m in a place different than those around me, and that I have to do something specific to put myself at the level of them. I need to do what they do so that I can become more connected to who they are. That is a pattern of action that has been present since I started drinking alcohol, where I felt that for resonating I needed to drink, so that I could become free of that voice and share my truth. But is it really my truth, or I am numbing something that I don\\u2019t want to see? That is the trick with alcohol and drugs. You end up not being able to go deeper, because you are comfortably numb. I was comfortably numb. And now I witness myself taking drugs and realizing, which is the aspect of them that makes me connect with them? I wonder where are the other people in terms of this whole awakening thing. Because I truly feel isolated, I truly feel alone. I don\\u2019t even know if it is something that should be talked about. For example, if I went to the house of my yoga teacher next week, would I ask him about waking up? I don\\u2019t feel comfortable with that, because there is this whole persona built around the spiritual aspect of wanting to be more spiritual. And where does that come from? I\\u2019m absolutely lost with this thing. Really. I keep running around the maze of my own mind, trying to get somewhere but not knowing where that somewhere is, and with an aspect of my mind telling me that that somewhere is just a mirage because there is nothing to be searched for because it is already here.

By just doing?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yesterday I wondered: How would an enlightened person feel if he got drunk? Or high? Or took some mdma?

Do I really care about mine? What kind of sports have I done in the last week? Ah\\xE1! I\\u2019m beginning to uncover the BS in there. That is the magic of this game, to be able to unlock that BS and spot it. And witness it. And realize that it is not going away. It is just part of what is. And that is the process that I need to go through to be more conscious. Each time that there is a thought going on, stare at it, and realize that I\\u2019m not it. I am the one that smoked pot yesterday, and I enjoyed it a lot. Everything that came with it. But I\\u2019m not the one that now is blaming himself for having done it.

I\\u2019m absolutely and completely identified with it. And it feels like the only way on which I\\u2019m going to be able to bring that into the earth is to go anon. To start sharing all of who I am from a place different from who I think I am. If I talk about myself as the name and character that I have been identified with all my life, it will be harder and harder to break free from the stuff. But if I open up the door for a new understanding, things will start happening from there. What is happening here is truly that I\\u2019m crafting the way on which I\\u2019m going to exist in the world. Yes. That much time I have available in my system.

I keep identifying with what I have to say as if it was the most important part of them all, not realizing that it is not. The important part is listening to others, it is to be there for them.

Am I the only one that spends this much time debating with myself about the aspects of myself that should be different but realizing at the same time that each shouldding is a construct of my own mind and that it is ok to give it up and just continue to move forward with what wants to be expressed through me?

I created it and it adds a lot of value, it is just that people don\\u2019t know it yet.

I know it exists because I have created it, but it is not something that the other people have in mind. They just go with their thing, and do their thing. And it is also important to witness the workflow of people as they go in it. For example, if you click a link on instagram that takes you there, you will end up going in through the app, so the website will be open in Instagram, and that is a very bad UX. As all people have told me until now, I should create an app. Maybe it is time for me to work in it using react native, so that more and more people can have it installed in their phone.

          "raw": "\nThis is one of those days on which my brain feels like it is going to explode. There is a lot happening in there, and I have not been able to build myself the time to give it some space. I mean, I slept a lot in the morning, but the kind of time that I feel I need for giving some space in there (meditating and writing) I have not been able to build it. I feel it, and because of that, I’m going to double down on that feeling by giving myself permission to just go and enjoy my little girl now. It is time for that. The vacation continues.\n\n--\n\nDuring all the day there has been this eternal willingness inside myself of being in a place different from that which I am now. Always running away from the present moment, searching for something that feels will never come. And it is exhausting. I have everything that I could have hoped for, but it is never enough. Nothing is enough. It’s funny, because I say that I have everything that I could have hoped for but I don’t have the most important thing of them all, someone to talk with right now. I was in the car and I said to myself: I will call a friend. But then I asked myself: Who could I call? Who do I really want to talk with right now? Who can understand what I’m going through? No one understands. But no one understands nothing really, that is the thing. I think that because I am in this process of spiritual awakening I’m special, but I don’t realize that I’m not. It is the part of me that is full of shit that is talking. The egoistic one. The one that wants to wake up, but from which my big self will wake up from. That is the one that is speaking when I refer to myself as someone special because I’m going through this process. Who is the I that I refer to? Who is the one that is writing?\n\nThat is the interesting part.\n\nWhat is going on in the life of every human being is informing to mine. The fact that I think that I’m special and I can’t relate to others because of this is what brings me to isolation, and to not being able to know what to create that can resonate with the people that will follow. I am the one that puts himself in an island, and is not willing to get out of there because it the place where I’m always running from.\nThere is like a thick layer of fog inside me that makes it hard for the words to come out. I forgot how to do this thing. I forgot what I was building, what I was writing about, what was going on in my life. In my whole being. The most important part of my life was happening, and I put myself in the middle and now it is lost. For wanting to resonate with the people that I was with, a lot of my behaviors changed, I put inside my body stuff that I was not used to, and now I feel that I lost a lot of the progress that I had done before. But is that even real? Is this progress lost in any way? That is the part of me that wants to achieve, that wants to get somewhere. He is the one that is scared that it will never happen. The most brutal part of truly wanting to wake up is the feeling that you will not make it. That you are not worthy enough. That it is not your time. The mind’s fear playing with you its strongest card. One that it is hard to know how to avoid. I mean. At least now, it feels impossible. I truly don’t know how to get away with that one. And there is a sensation present related to all this time having been wasted. What was I doing all this time trying and trying to wake up? Is that even possible? Is that something that can happen?\n\nThat’s why this book is called Dukkha. Because in here, I’m sharing with you the nightmare of being inside my own mind. The nightmare of always wanting something different, of building for myself the perfect life, of exploring every avenue that is in front in order to reach a particular outcome that doesn’t exist outside because it has always been here. It is so brutal to know this from the rational aspect of being, but now knowing how to translate it into a way of experiencing the world. As part of the truth by which I interact with everything that happens in front of me. I know that it is inside my own mind, but I truly don’t know how to get out of there. I mean, coming here and writing all this kind of relieves the pain, but… Sometimes it is hard to provide myself the time to do it.\n\nAnyway, the transformation is hard. The resistance is big. The willingness to control, to know, is one of the deepest ones of them all. At least inside me, it feels like the thing that commands everything. Like the one that is in the drivers seat. Control is in the drivers seat, and I don’t really know how to ask him to make some space so that I can hop in. It is brutal. I feel lost. I feel that I don’t truly know where I’m walking towards. What is happening in here? Which is the value that I’m adding to the world?\n\nIt is my capacity to reach out to people and leave an impression. That is something that I often underlook, and don’t give myself enough credit for. It is time for me to build up that credit, and open it to the world. There is an enormous value in the way of being that I have. That willingness to talk to strangers. To see the person at the other side of the conversation. To be curious. To explore. To learn. There is a huge breaking in my heart knowing that I won’t be able to reach out to most of them, I won’t be able to listen to their stories, I won’t be able to read every blog post, I won’t be able to study every book, I won’t be able to learn as much as I would like. It will never be possible. But it is ok. I can become free of that, by just learning how to be the most transparent version of myself. And I can only do that by sharing my truth, and my truth is created each time that I sit down to have a conversation with another human being. That is something that has come up a lot during these times.\n\nIt feels like the giving up of the effort is to stop talking about awakening at all. Stop giving it such an important space. Just let it happen, as I deepen my relationship with myself by exploring what every other human being has on offer. Build up the space for conversations to be had. Which is going to be the frame on which this conversation will be held? There is a big resonance in me that the biggest healer of them all can be just to have a conversation with another human being. To see yourself in the eyes of herself. Of the other self. Explore who you are by opening up to know who the other person is. And that can only happen if I open myself to it. It is the magic of being who we are. It is the magic of resonating with the story of who is at the other side. I can’t put myself labels. No label will fit. JPing. That is who I am. I’m just exploring who I am by interacting with people like you. That is everything that comes. Just open myself to the world an witness what is at the other side. It is magic. It is the truth. It is everything that I am, by exploring everything that I can be. Today I did the work at half, because I did not sit down for as much as I would have liked. But it is ok like that. Tomorrow is a new day. Now it is time to go and give love to my little daughter that is sick.\n\nThanks life.\n",

          "raw": "\nA questioning that has been present in this exploration is related to the name Dukkha. I started this project creating what would be a DAO for transformational journeys, for online meditation retreats, for people that want to Do The Work. The name Dukkha was brought into it because of what it brought into my awareness when I was in the last meditation retreat that I went. Eternal unsatisfactoriness. Always needing something different. Always wanting something more. Why would a project which’s aim is the complete opposite be named like that? And that is the questioning that has been inside me all this time. What is present inside me when I think about this project, when I write about it? Is it Dukkha? Is it this project the means by which I help the world get out of Dukkha?\n\nAnd the answer that comes more and more is related to what this book is. It is an absolute expression of the maze of my own mind. Of how Dukkha is expressed through me. The only way in is through, and what is happening in this book is me going through. Me deep in Dukkha. Each part of my being sunk in that way of existing, that willingness to get somewhere but not being able to. That willingness to go a little bit deeper but not being able, because it is not clear where to go. The last days I have been running in circles in this aspect, not being able to find the time to sit down and write what is going on. And what happens is very particular, because if I don’t do it I miss what will come up in that moment. It is not that there will be something not said, it is that an aspect of my life story will not be translated into this paper. And there is a huge loss in that, because that aspect is all of who I am. In that moment. This last week I have not been able to sit down to write whatever comes up, and in that, I miss that aspect of my whole process of diving deep into the waters of Dukkha. Of my own mind. Of the maze of my own mind. I keep running around in circles, but if I’m able to come here and write about it, at least it will stay out of my mind and in the domain of public knowledge forever. And that is the powerful part of being able to come here and write whatever comes up. It gets stuck in this paper. It is permanently written down here, as the testament of what I went through to realize more of what I already am. If I don’t Do The Work, I miss part of myself in the void of everything that went by and was not recorded.\n\nAnd most of the history of humanity is like that. Most of us will leave this world without a creation that will be the means by which history will remember us. Most of humanity works for a third party, which is not related to their own story, and in that, their own story gets lost. Of course the impact that you have in the story of that particular thing is important, but what is what you are going to get out from that? What is your legacy? What are you leaving behind in the world?\n\nAnd that is why the creative process is so important. Giving yourself time to sit down and transform into something concrete all of what you are in that moment, without caring if it is good or not. Just doing it for the sake of it. It has an aspect of transcendence, because it is what will remain from what you do. How are you going to open yourself to that?\n\nThat is what comes as a learning process from what was experienced by me the last week. Before it, I had a consistent practice of coming here and writing, which was lost because of being in another place, with other people, doing other things. I was not able to get into the flow of what I had to do, and that did not help me to become more of myself by sharing my truth with this blank page. My truth got stuck inside me, as I did not give space for it to come through in my creative act. And because of being stuck, I ended up with patterns of behavior that are different from those which I’m used to. And the consequence of that is that I was out of my center, navigating the experiences that I lived from there. But what if being out of my center is truly being in my center? What if the way on which I explore life more clearly is by just throwing myself out there and being a witness of how I react to it?\n\nI remember a therapy that I went, on which I had to choose a shape of feet that represented me. There were lots of couples of shapes, and there was only one that was one feet. That was the one that called me. The one that was alone. The unstable one. That’s what I came here to do, throw me into the uncomfortable and be a witness of how I react to it. That is the interesting part of this whole process, to be an explorer of how I react when I put at good use my chameleon like ways of being. I love being in different places, with different people, doing different things, and witness how I react to them. I’m not attached to any of them. I can eat all the pizza in the world, drink all the beer in the world, do all the drugs in the world, but not be attached to any of it. I go into the extreme, but it is not hard for me to come back. But I truly go all in. And that is an aspect of myself that is very important, and that I have a hard time understanding completely how it can be in service to the world. What is what I’m learning from myself by being part of completely different experiences? There is a lot of value on that.\n\nIf you are able to go into a course on blockchain, and after it go into a course on web design, and then go into a course on ecology, and then go into a course in woodworking, the way on which your brain has to adapt to all of that is powerful. It is intense, and powerful. And I’m like that, I have always been, and it is time for me to realize it, embrace it, and live from there. And also give me the space to come here and document the process, because that is where the real value comes from. Being able to process what has happened and give me the space to integrate it. Yesterday I read a piece about integration, and how much of a buzzword it is in the life of most people that do the things that I do.\n\nYou go to a transformational festival and then you have to integrate what you experienced. How do you do that?\nYou go into a meditation retreat and then you have to integrate what you experienced. How do you do that?\nYou go to a concert that changes your life and then you have to integrated what you experienced. How do you do that?\n\nBy allowing yourself to create from the heart. That is the answer that always comes. The ultimate aim of all of those experiences is to help us move a little bit closer towards the understanding of how to live more in the present. That is the ultimate goal that we should all strive for: How to live more in the present. How to be present. And that should be all what integration is about. How to be more present after the experience that you lived. Because if you go back to ‘normal life’ and start craving the sensations that you lived in the special event, you are living in the past. The event itself is doing something different than what it should do, it is bringing you out of the present. So how can you do that integration? How can you do more of it so that it can be transformed into the way on which you approach daily life? That is the goal. How can every aspect of our being be integrated so that everything that we live can be used as the means for living more present?\n\nBy creating something that did not exist before. I keep coming back to creativity, because it is the answer that my heart gives me. Every day. Create, and your presence will shine from there. In the act of creation that is done with intention, presence comes through. That is the key of it. The intention. It doesn’t matter for how long it is done. The important part is the intention. You may seat down to write for 4 minutes every day for 21 days. That’s it. But the important thing is for you to bring everything that you are to those 4 minutes, each time you do it. At first it will be hard, but if you are consistent with it, something will start happening. There will be a change that will come through. And that is everything that you need in order to bring forth that transformation. Those 4 minutes of pure presence will start to permeate the rest of your actions, until the doer is dissolved in the action itself. How would the world look like if we all acted from a place of presence, in each of our actions? What would we work on? Which are the jobs that are going to become obsolete and that make people have to do things that don’t require of their presence?\n\nI’m thinking about yesterday, when we came through a toll station in the highway and there was a woman in there singing out loud. You can choose to do that job with a good mood or with a bad one, but most of the times the latter will win, because it is something absolutely mechanical, which doesn’t require any aspect of that person being fully present to what is being done. Sure, calculate how much you have to give back as change, but not to much more than that. How will the world look like when all of these jobs are replaced by a robot? What will happen with all those human hours that will be freed from these mechanical jobs? What are they going to be invested in? That is the big question that I’m trying to answer with this writing, because I truly think that it is doing something creative. Creating. Nowadays we are so used to consume that this is something that doesn’t even cross our minds. How can we create if we don’t have time to do it? But people don’t realize how much they spend just consuming. Every series that you watch in Netflix is you consuming content. Every post that you witness in Social Media is time that you are consuming. And when you only consume, there is no aspect of yourself that is challenged. Sure, you can choose to take some action related to that consumption (like, comment, share, etc), but this is not something mandatory that comes from the consumption. Nope. It is a decision that you have to make, and one that is commonly done passively. Most of us don’t like to expose ourselves, and being behind the transparent window of our own phone is the great escape for being exposed.\n\nBut when you create you will be exposed. You will be challenged. You will have to face your own demons. And you will grow because of that. The act of bringing out something from your own mind into the world which other people can relate with is the biggest gift that you can do to yourself, but at the same time, one of the most challenging ones. You need to be open to that transformation. One thing is to go to a transformational event (Burning Man, Vipassana, etc) and another thing is to embody what was brought into your existence after that experience by acting upon the wisdom that was present in those times. How to bring more of that wisdom into every day actions? That is the game that we are learning to play here. Bringing us more and more into the present, by doing stuff that are intended for that. It can be meditation, it can be creating something, it can be breathing. Whatever practice that is designed for anchoring your consciousness into the present works as the means for doing this transition, for moving from time to timelessness.\n\nWhat helps you disconnect from the existence of time? Bring more of that into your life. Explore what happens in your whole being when more of that is present in what you do. It is the exploration that comes. It is where we are heading to. How would the world look like if more and more of us lived in the present moment?\n\nOr just if we collectively moved towards that. It can just be an aiming. A moving towards. That is where the transformation starts happening.\n\nHow do you see the world in the future? Which are going to be the activities on which we are going to spend our time? It is interesting to witness how we are evolving, and what is going on every day. For example, yesterday I found an app on which you write and it creates a movie with what you write. How does the world look like when each of us has the capacity to build something like that from scratch? That is what AI is bringing to us. It is helping each of us to become a creative, without the boundaries that we had before of having to be in a certain level so that you can share what you do. The field is getting more balanced, and the only thing that will remain present is that for you one hour is the same as for me. We may have a perceived difference in the exploration of time, but the present moment will be the same for each of us. And what comes from that realization? Until now, there is people that their time is more valuable in the economy than others. For example, if you are the CEO of a big company the amount of money that an unit of time of yours is worth is much bigger than if you are a gardener. But what happens if we create a means by which this is not true anymore? How would the world look like if we had a levelling field on which at least for 8 minutes every day the time of each of us would be the same? We all breathe, we all have particular aspects of our beings that are normal, and we can encounter each other human being in that common ground. How does that feel? What if those 8 minutes where the transformation that the world needs? What if those 8 minutes are the levelling ground on which we bring more presence into our life by just opening up to the possibility of connecting with whoever is at the other side, without the judgement of that person being superior or inferior? What if for those 8 minutes all of the labels were dropped, and we encountered each other just with what we are in that moment? Tell me who you are. That is the inquiry. Tell me who you are, for 4 minutes, as I listen absolutely present to what you say. And then it is my turn. I will tell you who I am. And that is the game. That is all what it takes. Just 4 minutes of inquiry. Of being fully present to the human being that is at the other side. Tell me who you are, and I’ll tell you too. What is at the other side? Who is at the other side? I am. The depth of who I am is witnessing myself from the other side. If I watch another person’s video, I open the possibility to record myself doing it. That is all what is needed. 4 minutes of being the witness, so that I can give you what I am. Tell me who you are. I’m here for you. And it can start as me, talking to the phone, just being who I am. Every day. And if I forget, it doesn’t matter, I can come back again tomorrow. But if I come with my truth I’m giving me the permission to offer it to who is at the other side. And that is the valuable thing.\n\nIt is the same that happened to me this last week. I did not come here to write, and I missed what would come through. Am I a worse person because of that? Nope. But I didn’t Do The Work, and it is in me. I am the one that did not open the door for that transformation to happen. If this app exists and I don’t go in there for my 8 minutes that day, I am the one that misses the opportunity for being there for the other person. Dime quien eres. Open up to what comes from that exploration. Give me all of what you’ve got, for only that time. Show up for yourself, and share everything that you have been in the process. Explore what comes. The interesting part of what is going on in the world right now is that we are reaching a point on which we can translate what is being said, and it can be said in our own language. So you can choose. You listen to the language of the other person, or you listen in your own one. It is your choice. But you can only do it once. And it will be lost. There won’t be any information to what the person is about, there won’t be any track. The only thing that happens in this, the simplest app of them all, is that you come in and listen to another person, and then you talk. And then another person will listen to what you say, and the chain will continue on and on. There only needs to be one person that starts the chain and from there it will flow. And each day every video will be destroyed. This is going to be the most valuable asset in the history of humanity, because it will speak to the truth of what we all are. There won’t be anything more important than this in the future. As computers get more and more sophisticated, they will be able to generate this conversations on the go. And the videos that will be recorded from now until that point are the ones that will have the information of how humans look like when they speak their truth. And with these videos, we will be able to gather the information of what a human being truly is.\n\nTell me who you are.\n\nDime quién eres.\n\nThat is the most basic prompt of them all, but if you consistently dive into the consequences of feeling it there will be a transformation that will take place within yourself. That is the game that this app will play. What happens if you open up to that truth. What is at the other side of witnessing that truth. Consciousness being conscious of itself. It doesn’t need to be good. It can’t be bad. It just can be. And it is the most simple UI and UX of them all. You come in, you see one person doing its thing, and you do yours. That is the game. That is what comes. What happens from this exploration will happen outside. And it will be donation based. There will be a bitcoin address which will receive what people want to donate, and with that, it will go on existing. It is as simple as this. The highest amount of traffic that will happen is the person receiving one video, and then sending one. And as soon as one video is seen, it will be deleted from the network. And with this it will keep running. No video will be seen twice. You can’t choose what video you will see. It will be an absolutely random process, with people from all over the world, asynchronous and conscious. The only amount of time that you are able to use the app is 8 minutes every day. That is all. You open it, download the video, watch it with all your attention, and then record yours. That is all what it takes. Then yours is sent to the cloud, and you will be notified when a new day starts. And we will keep like this, until eternity, until all of humanity is part of it. You won’t be drained of your energy, it is impossible, because all of the time that you use it will be consistent every day. What happens now with social media is that the amount of time that you use them is directly related to the amount of value that they are able to extract from you. What if this is capped to a maximum? How would your interaction with Twitter look like if you had only 30 minutes of usage every day? What word would define that interaction?\n\nINTENTION.\n\n--\n\nThe world that I’m opening here with my writing is the one of the ideas that are deeply rooted in my whole being. I’m writing this book as the means for integrating all the experiences that I have gone through, so that I can clarify clearly where I’m heading to. What I’m going to give my energy to. That is the key of this whole thing. And the idea that just came through is very powerful, because I can build it the same as Human Music, which is a radio that works 24/7 even if there is no one going in there and exploring what comes. I built it for that. And the idea that I just consolidated related to Tell Me Who You Are is the same. I can be the only one recording those videos until the end of my life. It doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is that I stay consistent, and with that, things will start happening. There is no better meditation than being truly present for another human being, and as soon as people realize that there will be traction in the app. The only thing that I need to truly take care of is to build it in a way that is solid, resistant. Because, what happens if there is a lot of traction and I don’t know how to react to that traction? What happens if it is shut down because of that traction? It will need to be strong, powerful, so that I can have it up and running always. That is probably my mission after I end up this book. But yes, that is me also going to the future, taking everything that I am right now and jumping to the future to build up something that is not existent yet. That is a big part of who I am. The one that jumps into the future and is building in there, instead of being here.\n\nIt is funny, because I’m writing that, so it means that I’m here, right now. It feels like I have one feet in the future, and another one here. Can you realize how much of a mess this is? That’s why I’m writing this book, so that I can truly be a witness of how much a mess this whole thing is. The mind. I’m completely open about how crazy I am. I can’t hide it. There is an absolute impossibility for me to hide it, because each time that I come here to write my craziness shines through everything that I say. Jumping from one place to another. From this moment to the future. But I wonder: Is it that I’m writing in this moment and I’m being on the future? Or the fact that I’m doing this is a representation of me being in the present, just dreaming about something that is not real yet? Yes… That is something that comes to my mind a lot. Where does thinking lie in this whole process of being present? If I’m not my thoughts, and each time that I go with one thought I go away from the present moment, how can I think? Which is the proper process of thinking? How should I think?\n\nAnd that’s why this book is called ‘The End Of Shoulds’. As if there was a particular way of thinking. What a nonsense. How could there be a particular way of thinking. See, that is how much I love being in control of what happens in my domain of action. I even think that there is a specific way of thinking that is better than another one. That is the mind playing its game. Building an artificial separation in my domain of action. In my life. In what is happening in front of me. Trying to find the ‘optimal way of thinking’, so that I can get the most out of life. How can that be a reality? How can there be a ‘good’ way of thinking and a ‘bad’ one? I just am. I just explore. Let that exploration come forth, and witness it with awe and curiosity. That is what good thinking is about, just letting it be. Just going with it and realizing that it is good as it is.\n\nIt is quite nice to assume that I’m crazy. It feels freeing. It feels good. Witnessing myself write these words and realizing how crazy I am that I’m talking to myself in this way. That maybe no one will ever read this, and it is ok like that. Because I will read it. It is the most important thing that I have done in my life, to express the truth of who I am by exploring what comes when I sit down and empty myself into this words. Into the exploration. Into the void. It doesn’t matter how good it is, it doesn’t matter which is the content, it doesn’t matter how it feels. It matters that it feels. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. Let what comes come, and just feel it. Be there for it. Witness it and explore what is at the other side.\n\nThe way on which the world is unfolding is just amazing. Everything everywhere all at once. It is happening, and it has been happening since the dawn of time. But we are getting to the point on which more and more of us are able to realize that we are here. We are just being. That is the important part. That we are. And it is the one that is harder to manifest as a solid understanding in one’s own existence, because it is taken for granted. Most of us take life for granted. Each breath is granted. Of course we are going to take that next breath. How couldn’t we, it is part of who we are. It is part of who we have always been. But what happens when that breath is not there anymore? What remains when you stop breathing? What remains when you are not there anymore?\n\nThat’s one of the koans that stuck deep: You minus you. That’s all what is.\n\nWho are you when you are not you anymore? What are you? What remains?\n\nThat is the exploration that comes forth as you come here and do the work of being the witness of another human being doing his or her thing. That is the exploration of the unknown, and it is one of the key aspects of what I spoke about before. With the technology that is in place now, we can do it. I can assure that the person that is at the other side of the screen records him or herself in a way that is appropriate for the whole game, and that will make everything work as a clock. Holy shit, I really want to bring this into existence. It feels like the most important work that I can do. The self inquiry app. The dyads. Tell me who you are in a global level, with automatic translation made by an AI model that will be developed open source. That is the ultimate open source project, being able to translate what is being said in real time. Actually, this whole app needs to be open source. And hosted in the blockchain. Is it possible that it is hosted in the blockchain? How can a video be hosted in the blockchain? It will be very important to be able to compress the information so that it can be transferred efficiently. I’m excited with the idea, really. It has a lot of potential, I’m sure about that.\n\nAnd I’m also excited about this place that I have built for myself as the playground. Life has given me the opportunity to play, to share with you what is inside me, to distill each part of my being into the words that come up. Be open with them. Be ok with what is. Life has given me the opportunity to trust in me enough so that I can just be with what I am right now. And it truly feels good. It doesn’t matter what ends up happening, it just matters that it is. It just matters that I show up and continue to do my best. This will be what remains. These words are going to be my legacy, the way on which I have spoken from the heart. What I’m learning how to do here is to eliminate the mediation from my mind in the creative process, and that is something that I open day by day. And if I’m drunk, I need to come here, so that that drunkness can be expressed into what I write. It is part of who I am, and it will be important to be a witness of it. How is my writing when I’m drunk? How does it look like when I’m high? How does it look like when I take mushrooms? Those are all ways on which I can better explore who I am, because all of those changes are in the level of mind. If I’m drunk, it is in the level of mind, in the level of the interface on which I relate to the world. But awareness is just aware. It is just there, in the background, being a witness of what is going on. So what happens if I just open myself to be that witness? If I explore what is in there? That’s where true freedom comes from. That is the true end of shoulds. It is not about giving up drinking, or taking drugs, or whatever. It is not about doing X or Y. It is about exploring what remains when all of those things are present as an activity of the mind. It is about exploring what is the underlying presence that is constant as all those changes are happening at the level of mind. Only there is where Dukkha ends, when there are no more judgements related to the actions that are taken.\n\nAnother way of talking about the end of shoulds is talking about the end of judgements. What remains when there are no judgements anymore? When I truly accept every aspect of my being as a consequence of all of who I am?\n\nFreedom to be. What I decide to be. Freedom to create, what I decide to create, without the boundaries that are imposed by the creation having to be something particularly ‘good’. It is crazy to see that most of our judgements come from the place of being that does not accept all of what we are. I saw that clearly in a meditation retreat, on which there was a noble silence restriction imposed, and in each sitting at the dining table I saw myself judging all of what the other people were putting into their plates. And suddenly I realized that I was just judging myself, because I could not accept the way on which I brought stuff into my plate. Through the judgment that I was imposing on others, I was just judging myself. And that is true for every judgement that comes from the mind, because they are all related to aspects of yourself that are not resolved. That I don’t accept inside me. So how can I truly be free if I am the one that judges himself? If I am the one that feels that is not worthy of what can happen to him? That’s why the biggest work that you can do is internal, because all of the shit that you have inside ends up being manifested in the way on which you relate to the outside. Those are the consequences of it. Judgement. Separation. If I judge myself through the judgement that I feel related to the way on which you behave, there is a strong aspect of separation between me and the reality that is present in front of my experience. And I can’t be free if that is going on. So the best I can do is just work on myself so that I can integrate all these aspects of myself that I judge, so that I can understand where do they come from.\n\nWhat is wrong with my relationship with food that I judge?\nWhat is wrong with my relationship with others that I judge?\nWhat is wrong with my relationship with myself that I judge?\n\nThese are all questions that can bring me deeper into the exploration of who I can be, or better said, who I already am. All these aspects of separation that are present and that make me judge me and feel separated from the truth of what is being expressed through my actions are information, the most valuable information that I can use as the means for better understand embody my experience as a human being. There is nothing to be understood, because all understanding comes from the level of mind. This needs to be felt, truly integrated from the depth of who I am. Only through that I will be able to become free of the burden of having to be someone different from who I already am. If I drink that beer, it is ok, it is just the expression of who I’m being in that moment, one that needs that satisfaction, or connection, or numbness, to make some kind of progress in his life. If I take drugs, it is just more of what needs to happen in my life so that I can become more of myself. If I’m not able to come here and write, it is just what needs to happen so that I can go through what comes at the other side. It is not about being a passive ameba in the world, it is the complete opposite. It is just to truly feel everything that is present, and with that, move towards a better embodiment of all what is present in my experience as a human being.\n\nThe word integration came up again, and a wondering of which is the relationship between the process of integration and this acceptance. What is the relationship between the words integration and judgement? What comes is related to what is experienced in a transformational event. Most of the times, something different from what is present in daily life goes on there. And there is a judgement when coming back, related to your life not being as attuned to that special experience as it should be. That is a big judgement that happens. I’m not good enough at this game of life because I still have the problems that make me feel the kind of separation that is felt when I come back from Burning Man. How can’t I relate to my co-workers the same as I did during that week in the dust? Why are these feelings present in myself as I come back to normal life? There is a constant judgement that is expressed by all those thoughts about how life ‘should’ be and it is not. And that is what the integration is about. The most important aspect of it is related to accepting that it is not, and moving forward with the knowledge that it just is. You don’t relate to your coworkers as you would like, because it is not only in your control. We humans are dynamic forces of nature, and you can’t expect that because you came with a particular energy from a particular event everyone will be at that same frequency. The more you realize that you can’t control the experience of other human beings, the smoother this integration process will be. Because there will be a deep realization that it is not the work that you have to do. The end of shoulds is also realizing that it is not your work to change anyone. No one should be as you expect them to be, that is just your ego wanting to be the savior of the world. Perharps that is the biggest consequence of all that has been written in this book. It is not my job to change anyone, and in the moment on which I’m able to truly embody that I will become free.\n\nAnd with freedom comes the ability to truly enjoy every aspect of how life force is expressed through each human being that is alive. Yes. That is the consequence of freedom. Acceptance. To what is. To all of those who already are what they came here to be. And have always been. It is just the mind playing its separation game, its game of wanting to be more, of wanting to control, of wanting things to be different, of wanting to know more, to learn more, to live more, to bring more out of life. To bring the most out of it. But the only way on which that is going to be a reality is by just embodying what comes when there is acceptance of what is. And that acceptance truly comes from within, from the understanding that I am perfect as I am right now. That there is nothing that should be changed in my experience as a human being right now, because all of that which is thought that needs to be changed is just that, a thought. And thoughts come and go. They are not what determines the expression in reality of who I am. I seem to be a verb, not the thoughts that go on the back of that verb. I seem to be something that is not static. I seem to be moving. I seem to be something that is always changing, always becoming. I just seem to be, and every aspect of myself that tryies to build a different reality from that is the mind, it is all of what I’m not. I seem to just be, and it feels good that way. It feels like freedom. It feels like the pure expression of what I came here to be, and it feels that that is they way towards the end of suffering. The only way in is through, and the only way of going out of the maze is having fun inside it.\n\nEmbody each aspect of myself that the maze shows me.\nEmbody each piece of the puzzle that is brought up.\nEmbody the dark aspects, and the light ones. They all constitute the integrity and richness of this experience.\nEmbody the lazy one, the disciplined one.\nEmbody what comes when I give up, and when those sensations of not being enough arise.\nEmbody the one that feels anger, because all of that anger is an expression of who you are not.\nEmbody all the sensations that are felt in the body. They are the purest information that you can get.\nEmbody everything that you are, and everything that you have been. It is a miracle, and every breath you take is a gift.\n\n--\nThe only way in is through, and I’m done with the suffering. I’m done with Dukkha, and the only way out of it, is by exploring how every aspect of myself feels by being completely immersed in it.\n",

The field is getting more balanced, and the only thing that will remain present is that for you one hour is the same as for me. We may have a perceived difference in the exploration of time, but the present moment will be the same for each of us. And what comes from that realization? Until now, there is people that their time is more valuable in the economy than others.

What if those 8 minutes where the transformation that the world needs? What if those 8 minutes are the levelling ground on which we bring more presence into our life by just opening up to the possibility of connecting with whoever is at the other side, without the judgement of that person being superior or inferior?

There won\\u2019t be any information to what the person is about, there won\\u2019t be any track. The only thing that happens in this, the simplest app of them all, is that you come in and listen to another person, and then you talk. And then another person will listen to what you say, and the chain will continue on and on. There only needs to be one person that starts the chain and from there it will flow. And each day every video will be destroyed. This is going to be the most valuable asset in the history of humanity, because it will speak to the truth of what we all are. There won\\u2019t be anything more important than this in the future. As computers get more and more sophisticated, they will be able to generate this conversations on the go. And the videos that will be recorded from now until that point are the ones that will have the information of how humans look like when they speak their truth. And with these videos, we will be able to gather the information of what a human being truly is.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Tell me who you are.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Dime qui\\xE9n eres.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"That is the most basic prompt of them all, but if you consistently dive into the consequences of feeling it there will be a transformation that will take place within yourself.

It doesn\\u2019t need to be good. It can\\u2019t be bad. It just can be. And it is the most simple UI and UX of them all. You come in, you see one person doing its thing, and you do yours. That is the game. That is what comes. What happens from this exploration will happen outside. And it will be donation based. There will be a bitcoin address which will receive what people want to donate, and with that, it will go on existing. It is as simple as this. The highest amount of traffic that will happen is the person receiving one video, and then sending one. And as soon as one video is seen, it will be deleted from the network. And with this it will keep running. No video will be seen twice. You can\\u2019t choose what video you will see. It will be an absolutely random process, with people from all over the world, asynchronous and conscious. The only amount of time that you are able to use the app is 8 minutes every day. That is all.

You won\\u2019t be drained of your energy, it is impossible, because all of the time that you use it will be consistent every day. What happens now with social media is that the amount of time that you use them is directly related to the amount of value that they are able to extract from you. What if this is capped to a maximum?

And suddenly I realized that I was just judging myself, because I could not accept the way on which I brought stuff into my plate. Through the judgment that I was imposing on others, I was just judging myself. And that is true for every judgement that comes from the mind, because they are all related to aspects of yourself that are not resolved. That I don\\u2019t accept inside me.

What is the relationship between the words integration and judgement? What comes is related to what is experienced in a transformational event.

And there is a judgement when coming back, related to your life not being as attuned to that special experience as it should be. That is a big judgement that happens. I\\u2019m not good enough at this game of life because I still have the problems that make me feel the kind of separation that is felt when I come back from Burning Man. How can\\u2019t I relate to my co-workers the same as I did during that week in the dust? Why are these feelings present in myself as I come back to normal life? There is a constant judgement that is expressed by all those thoughts about how life \\u2018should\\u2019 be and it is not. And that is what the integration is about. The most important aspect of it is related to accepting that it is not, and moving forward with the knowledge that it just is.

          "raw": "\n    That moment on which you decide to engage in a conversation that you wouldn’t have before, just because there was something that you needed to do. And what comes out of that conversation is pure magic, and it makes you feel alive. How can this serendipity be fostered in the digital age? When there is a decision to be made to be or not to be connected? If I go downtown there is not a conscious decision if I meet a random person or not, it just happens. But on the internet you have to decide to go in there, and be part of the thing at first. And that can be challenging to understand how to deal with. But once you realize that you can create new types of serendipity, stuff starts to happen. Random connections start happening. It is not about the moment on which the connection is made, but the connection itself. If you go into twitter, you’ll never know who you will encounter. It is defined by an algorithm that takes into consideration most of your previous interactions, but there still an aspect of randomness there related to you not knowing what will show up. That is part of the beauty of the whole thing. It also happens in YouTube, in Tik Tok, in any social media actually. You’ll never know what you will encounter when you go into it, and that is where the fun comes from. This aspect of not knowing feels good.\n\n    And now what I’m thinking is: Why is that not knowing safe, exciting, and the not knowing what will happen in the future of our lives not? Which is the difference between both of those not knowings? I wonder and I question that within myself. I guess that there is something in there related to the system not knowing if you are interacting with it or not. Or you thinking that it doesn’t know. Because IRL, you get immediate feedback related to your interaction with a particular situation. The world knows what happens with you, how you reacted to the thing. Here, you don’t really know, it is a mystery, and the fact that mystery is in your control feels safe. It is safe to be a witness to what other people are doing and not having to interact with it in a way that they’ll know what is going on. It is safe to be a witness that is not doing anything for the other people to know that you are witnessing. You can behave in any way, not in how it is expected. There are not many expectations, because: How could they know? How could you know that I actually consumed that piece of content that you shared? You can’t, and I use that in my benefit to actually not do something particular. To stay hidden below my shell and not impacting you in any way. It is present everywhere, as soon as we decide to make stuff public for people to interact with it or not.\n\n    And how can that be used in benefit of creating Dukkha in a way that is actually helpful? Is it necessary for some content to be consumed in a particular way? It is interesting to think about that, because of the consequences that consumption has in the way that the content is structured. For example in twitter, there is a huge movement of people that teach ‘how to be successful in twitter’. What are the steps that you need to do. And in that information there is a lot about being consistent, and a lot of engaging with other, being a cool human being. Isn’t that what we all should strive for? Why do I need the reassurance of one of this cool accounts to tell me how I should do it? What are the steps that need to be taken? Because here is where the clickbait counts more than anywhere else, because the attention is needed for the content to shine. You need to get peoples attention, and the way to do that is to follow a particular set of guidelines. Is it selling yourself? Maybe. But you are selling yourself, learning to play a game, in order to have something cool going on afterwards. Right now I’m creating my content for no one, just for the open space. Wouldn’t it be nice to have more people interacting with it, so that it had a bigger impact? Isn’t that what I should strive for? But really, is that what I need? Is that what Dukkha needs?\n\nI don’t think so, because it is easy to get lost in the quest for that attention. But what comes before attention is trust, and that trust can be built step by step by creating something cool that actually helps people more than something that just appeears on their feed. My content deserves more attention, and what I’m willing to do for that attention is more than just creating some tweets and being consistent with that. But maybe I’m saying this because part of my unconscious wants that attention, I don’t know. But the thing is that you spend all this time learning to play the game, copying ideas and content from other people so that you can phrase it in a way that can be appealing and learning how to produce reactions. And the end of the day, it is all about reactions, and how people interact with your content in a way that produces that reaction from them. That is how we feed ourselves in social media, from those reactions that bring up the emotions that are produced when something cool happens with the content that we have produced. Do I want that reactions? Is that what I’m aiming to? I’m not sure, I don’t think. What makes more sense to me is a different way of interacting with the internet, one on which I add value consistently in a way that is more focused, on which people have to spend more of their time in. When they go into social media, their frame of reference is not related to ‘I want to better understand about life, so I’ll go into twitter to find out how to be a better human being’. Or maybe it is, I don’t really know, but I know that twitter for me is not about growing and growing, it is about having an avenue on which to express my thoughts and engage with cool people. That is what I need to start doing, engaging with cool people from which I can learn. I haven’t done it consistently and it is something that will bring value to my life, because it is good to share and learn from other people. But don’t get crazyon the quest of adding followers, because that is not the means on which people will get to this DAO. It needs to be more focused than that.\n\n    And where does that focus come from? What comes to mind is spaces with like minded individuals. Ancient psyuchoneats that want to deeper ex`pre consciousness. The ones that hang out in rowid, the ones that have had a psychedelic therapy and have a experiential understanding that there is more than what they have experienced, and want to tap into that. The ones that want to create a major shift in their life, and who are willing to create a creative expression that is absolutely unique to theirs. The ones that are able to take a month out of their work, their life, so that they can become more and more of what they truly are. That is the mission of this whole thing, to use all these tools to help people to become more of what they truly are, what they have always been.\n\n    The means for this is acknowledging the origins of the word therapists, that in greek mans something like: ‘That who has the power to hold space for other people to heal themselves0. This whole thing is about healing, but healing from a place of wanting to face the strongest demons, and more through life with the integration of that process of being a witness. Each of us is a witness of the own demons that run through the mind of that person, and in the understanding of that as. A reality there is a freedom that comes. There is a particular aspect of human existence that resonates with this whole thing, and that is your soul. Who you are beyond you. What underlies your whole expression. Your core being. Your true self. Awareness itself. You are awareness, wanting to express itsel through the vessel that JP is. That is the amazing part of thins whole journey, how much of this is connected to the past and to the future. If you are able to recognize the past in your present, you will be heading to the future with a strong udnderstanding of who you are, and that will open the doors of any endeavor that you decide to start because presence is the whighest form of intelligence.  It is huge. It is a miracle.\n\n    It is time to acknowledge the miracle and start living from that acknowledgment. With gratitude, one of the most important aspects of the human experience. Gratitude for all of what has been, for all that is. For the truth of what is. For what comes after the integration of that truth in your self. Of being that truth. This whole experience and every one of them will be an exploration into that truth, and how each of our individual human expressions are the means by which it is expressed in the world. It is a window into the marveling for that. About that. Let yourself be in awe, full of wonder, because each moment that exists is a present. Everything that you are experiencing right now is a present that your former self is giving you, and in each aspect of it there is something that could be thought of as joyful.\n\n    It is easy to forget the particular gift that each of us brings to the world, because it is hard to realize what it is. In the morning I was talking to a colleague and she told me about how scarce it is to have people that are willing to hold space. To just hold space for things to happen. And that’s crazy, because for me it is such a natural thing, that I never stopped for a while to realize how valuable it is. If she hadn’t told me, I would have taken it as a must, as something that is present in the human experience per se, and it would have gone like that. But because she told it to me, I came into the realization that yes, it is something scarce, it is something valuable, and I see myself and what I do differently after that realization. So the invitation that I’m making to you as I bring this story up is for you to realize what is that value in you that you are not being able to see. Open yourself to the world, share yourself, so that the world can reflect you back and tell you what that present that you are bringing is.\n\nIf I come and ask you: Who are you? Who is the one that is receiving that question? What is that question bringing up in your system? What are the layers that your mind builds right away to explain rationally who you are? What do those layers tell you about yourself and the way on which you see yourself? All of this is information, it is what will help you to realize that you are not the only one that pushes himself down. You are not the only one that thinks that she is not enough. It happens to all of us, and in the acknowledgement of that there is a collective power that can be unleashed. It is very common in our modern society to spend a long time comparing our experience with the one of others, and what that brings is a difficulty in being truly happy for other person’s success. That is something that happens, and it is something that we need to acknowledge so that we can move on with the integration of what were the means that created this as a consequence. Then we were young we were conditioned to believe that our success is determined by the scale that we hold in a particular range of people. If I have better grades, I’m more capable at X than the person that is next to me. That comparison is horrible, it creates a lot of hard, and it is one of the things that will be evolving throughout the Yeats. It is quite obvious right now that the way out is not being independent and having the best grades in class, but being interdependent and finding solutions with each other. I was never told truly how to work as a team, and it is something that I lack completely. But it doesn’t need to stay there forever, because as soon that it is realized as a consequence of what has happened, I’m able to break free from it as a conditioning. It is very deep in my structure and how I see the world, but the brain is constantly evolving and there can be a time on which this conditioning is not there anymore.\n\n    There is a big sensation of sleepiness, which bringing memories of how nice it is to have the eyes closed and just listen to the music. There are memories running through of many different electronic music parties, dancing at the center of the dance floor always with the eyes closed. Not caring about anything that was going on the outside, just feeling and experiencing what the music was bringing in the inside. Such amazing meoments of exploration into just being. Just taking care of that moment, and fully being the music. SO much learning and value as been derived from al of that experience. It is felt as a massage to the brain, as a breaking free of throughs, or more than breaking free from throughs, it is about breaking free from the necessity of controlling them. Just letting them flow freely through the whole system, and now there is a willingness present of just enjoying it. But that same willingness builds up a separation between the muysc and my Self, because it is always referencing something that will happen in the future. One day I will clean this part of the house. One day I will build up the space for us to grow vegetables. It is always related to the future, and how I will be able to control the future in order ro have a beetter life. Always that life conditioned to what can happen afterwards, not what is happening now. That is part of what is being brought up in this process, and it is brutal to be a true witness of that. To see from the inside of my being the way on which the mind works, always telling stories, always being trapped somewhere in that limbo of the past and future. What should have been, what could be. Always dancing in that limbo, but eventually grasping towards the balance.There is knowledge about where that balance is, about where it has been all the time. It is there, inside, waiting for me to realize it and embrace its location. Closer than close. That is the place where the pond of the mind stops having ripples and it becomes clear, transparent. That is where stuff starts getting interesting, because the knowledge comes from a place of truth. Of true knowing. And there is knowledge that that place is related to balance, to getting into that place of stillness within.\n\n· · ·\n\n    Have you done some of the work that is needed to dissolve the stuff within you that feels uncomfortable? Or more than feeling uncomfortable, that make you feel identified with those feelings. There are aspects of you that identify with those situations, feelings and sensations unconsciously, and if you don’t do the work of making them part of your conscious processes they will always be there, making you feel identified with them. That is part of the work that you have to do, bringing that into the conscious patterns, shining a light on them, so that you can move towards an integration of all those aspects into yourself. This will free up amazing amounts of energy that are stuck in those patterns, and all that energy will be available to be used in the pursuit of something different. Something creative. All your creativity will be fueled with all this energy that will be freed. You came here to just be. Enjoy that. Enjoy yourself and everything that you are capable of.\n\n· · ·\n\n    There is a certain judgment present related to not being such deep in a state of flow while writing today. There is a feeling present that is more… Passive. There is not too much coming out, and that is interesting because it is an exploration into what happens when there is permission to just write whatever comes up. To report from there. This ends up being the same as that game of self inquiry dyads, of prompting the other person ‘Tell me who you are’, and just letting that person report what comes up. So this is me reporting whatever comes up in this process of trying to write about what it feels to awaken. I don’t really know how it feels to awaken, it seems like I will be all this lifetime running behind something that runs much faster than me, but I can certainly tell you how it feels to run and run and run and not reach it. It is exhausting, but at the same time fulfilling. There is a deep sense that there is nothing more important to do than this. That there is nothing more important than knowing the truth. How could anything be more important than knowing the truth? There is a deep wondering of how can this not be as true for other people as it is for the one that is writing this words with his 10 fingers. What other endeavor could be more important than knowing the truth? Saving the world from climate change? Helping my local community to strengthen their bonds? Writing a book? I don’t really know, but for me, it certainly feels that there couldn’t be anything more important than this. So that’s why I come back to playing this game, of just reporting what comes, so that there can be a process of emptying inside. There is strong need of becoming empty, of all the words that had to be said but never were said, of all the messages that wanted to be conveyed but never were. Of all the people that wanted to be approached but that feeling of insecurity wouldn’t let it happen. It doesn’t really matter now, or it matters, because it is material for doing the process of integration of what is present here. Of what has always been present, in one way or another. Every story is a summary of all of the others. As above, so below, in everything, everywhere, all the time. Each thing that happens throughout your lifetime is a window of exploration into everything that has ever been, and everything that will ever be. As soon as you start realizing this you will be free, because there won’t be a necessity of being in a place different from where you are, so that you can achieve something ‘more’. Everything is here, right now, today. Everything that you need to be is here, right now, today. Realize that, and be free. This is the time for it. This is the perfect time.\n\n    There is a remembering of the words that were written previously. All the time running on the back of something that runs much much much faster than me. That has way more resources. So what if I stopped running? What if I stopped chasing it? How would the relationship with it evolve because of that ceasing? What a nice exploration that is. Stop running and let it just be. That is the key, to stop running. To realize more and more all those times that there has been someone running, and just make it conscious for it to stop. There is no need for you to be running, there is only a need for you to be. A need that comes from within, so that the deepest layers of who you are can be expressed through each action that your being goes through. Each action, each moment, is a window into eternity. How do you want to be remembered? As eternity itself, and for that, you need to forget who you are. You need to lose yourself into what you are doing, and the way into that is not trying. It is just doing. Every action is an exploration into the power of just doing. Just do. Just explore. There are no direct consequences, each consequence is just an invention of the mind, because all that exists is only a succession of moments that are one window after the other one. It doesn’t really matter. It truly doesn’t really matter. It just is. It will always be. Every moment will always just be, and every thought that the mind can generate about it is just that, a construct that comes from the mind and its preferences. Learn to recognize that, and break free from the identification from them. You are not the thoughts, those are just an interpretation of what is going on. But what is going on is going on, and no interpretation is more than just, an interpretation. Each human being has a different interpretation, and it is impossible for each of us to understand what the interpretation of another person is, because it is fundamentally different. You see life through you own lens. Realize that, and become free from the need for other people to understand how your lens looks like. Become free from understanding how the lens of other people look like. Just enjoy it. Be amazed by it. Be in awe. Each life experience is a window into the understanding of human nature, into the understanding of how each of us is built because of its life experiences. Give yourself the permission to be free. Give yourself the permission to realize that you are not in control of the interpretation that other people have of your actions. They have the freedom to build an image of who you are in their own minds, and this is not something that is at the reach of your control. Be free of wanting to control that. Just be free. Just express yourself as free as you can, and let them have their trip. Let each person have their own trip. And enjoy it from your perspective. Be amazed by what they say to you, and learn to see in each judgment an invitation to a deeper understanding of their own journey.\n\nIf they judge you about the food you eat, what does that tell you about the relationship that they have with the food that they eat?\n\nIf they judge you about what you say, how secure are they about what they say?\n\nIf they judge you about your friends, on top of what are their friendships built?\n\nIf they judge you about what you decide not to do, what does that tell you about their capacity to say no?\n\nEach interaction is an opportunity to learn more about the human experience. Enjoy the ride. It is quite a fun one. Each of us has its own stuff buried inside. Realize this and be free of the one that you have. It is not your burden, it is just the reality of how things are right now. Don’t be identified by them. Let them just be. They are. Let things be right as they are.\nAnd this is what will end up happening. What you have been witnessing as you read what I write here. Stuff just wants to come out, in whatever form. There is no need to control the form, there is no need to control what actually comes out. That would be related to a particular judgement of things being in a different way from what they actually are. From me being someone different from who I am, but this is who I am, this is everything that I am, and I’m presenting myself with that here, now. It’s time to embrace it and just let it express itself through this words. There will come a time on which I come back here and read what was written and recognize me through this words, but for now, what I need is only to bring them out. To make space inside. For it to shine through.\n\nI always wonder about artists that have lost themselves in their craft. When Freddie Mercury sings ‘Surrender your ego, be free, be free’. Is he singing from a place of non-duality? Has he realized his true nature and he is speaking from that place? Which is the difference from inhabiting life from that place and from the place on which he sings? Does there need to be a deep exploration into all these means that are used for transcending the ego and the mind when the creative expression has reached a point like that? That is a wondering that runs a lot through my mind, as I move towards finding my own way of expressing my voice, of sharing it with the world.\n\n· · ·\n\nRight now thoughts come through related to the gap that old people have with technology and their lack of understanding of it, and me talking to my parents the other day, trying to tell them about what I experienced in the retreat that I went in Canada, which’s main objective was to generate conditions of no escape for the ego, so that awareness could realize itself and I could become free. I found myself talking to them about all this concepts, trying to be as clear as I could, but knowing that on their mind everything that I was saying was just noise. There is a big gap there, and as I was helping my mother with her phone now I realize that that gap was also there. Is it that they don’t want to open up to the possibility of knowing? Where does all that come from? Throughs like that come to my mind, because there is a need of wanting to help them, but not really knowing how to do it. Let them have their trip, it is ok if they don’t know how to do it. The frustration is more in me, that I know what is possible, than in then, that they don’t know.\n\nIf I talk about being conscious and this whole awakening thing, there is frustration in me when they don’t understand what I’m talking about because I know that there is something that they could be seeing and they are not. There is a bigger aspect of reality that they are missing because the frame of reference from which they are interacting with this whole thing is limited. But it is limited in my view, in the projection that I create inside myself about their experience here. It is not limited in their view, because their view is contained in the reference points from which they explore this thing. So these limitations are just built on my mind, not in theirs, and that creates this frustration, but in myself. I am the one that wants them to experience something more. They are not. So when is the point that I truly realize this and become free of the burden of wanting to show them that there is something more?\n\nThe same goes for technology, and this is where this parallel starts to make sense. As I see them interact with it, and not understand, and eventually give up, there is a feeling of frustration in me related to what they are missing out by not facing what happens when you try to figure things out. At the end, all this technology thing is an eternal trial and error, on which you make mistakes and then you learn from there, understanding what you need to do the next time so that you don’t make those mistakes. It goes like this on and on. But in the case of older people who grew without it, when they were young a mistake was much more expensive than now. It was not as easy as now to delete it and start fresh. So there is a much bigger resistance in them to expose themselves to mistakes, because they are conditioned by their experience to suffer more consequences from them than what is true right now. And that is the aspect that is interesting about this parallel that I’m making. On my view of them, they are lacking something, they are not living to their full potential, because they are not giving themselves the space to make those mistakes and learn from them. They are missing out of a huge opportunity of taking more advantage of the tools that they have at hand. But that is only in my mind, in my experience, because I am the one that knows the gap between the usage that they are giving to their energy now. I am the one that knows how much space for growth they have. But they are not. And they don’t care about it. They just enjoy whatever limited thing they are doing, and from there they learn how to make the best out of it. They truly don’t care about where that limit is, because for them that limit is already there, at the boundary of what they do. They don’t want to go further down from that boundary. And it is ok like that. But now I’m able to recognize this, as I see myself trying to bridge that gap for them.\n\nI see that they use X percent of their capabilities, both in their phone and in their existence as human beings, and I want that X to grow because I know that there is a lot of space for growth. But they don’t want. So what does this produce in the interaction of us= From my side, frustration because my expectation of what can be achieved in the interaction of them with the technology or with themselves is not met, and in them also frustration because I’m bot seeing them for who they truly are, I’m seeing them through the image that I think that they can become. I see who they can become if they are able to do what I think is good for them, and I put this image between me and my interaction with them, so there is always a misrepresentation between what I see of them, and what I expect from them. And this brings suffering, so the good thing to do would be to just speak their language, and learn from their perspective of things.\n\nThey are a human being as valuable as me, and as soon as I open myself to learn from them as they are now, I set up myself for a growth that is not present right now. AS soon as I become a witness from their interaction with a particular piece of technology, I open myself to the possibility of learning how to become a better builder of systems, because I can create something more accessible thinking on the means that they have at their hand. Not what I expect them to do so that they use the whole potential of the thing (their human condition and their phone) but by who they actually are, and the way that they actually interact with their stuff. This is the magic of meeting people were they are, and not thinking that I’m in a different place than them because I know more about myself or I know better how to use a particularr piece of technology. This is a big bias from the mind, wanting to believe that it is in a different place because of the journey that has been travelled, not having in mind that each journey is unique in its own way, and that each moment, each interaction, is a window into a better understanding of oneself.\n\nWhat happens if instead of correcting my mother for what she did ‘wrong’ in her interaction with her phone, I sat down a bit longer with that willingness to help her and realized where it is coming from? What could I learn from me in that process?\n\nWhat if instead of wanting them to evolve spiritually in a particular way, I opened myself up to recieving whoever their are at this stage of evolution and let that speak to me about their true self and how it expresses through that particular person in that particular moment.\n\nAlways have in mind that time is a construct of the mind, and the fact that I think that there is a particular ‘evolution’ towards something that is taking place is a construct of the mind, because each of us is already and have always been everything that we will ever be in any particular moment. It is just about taking out the sheet that won’t let it be seen between any mind and the expression of reality that is in fromt of my eyes. Open yourself to the true understanding of what is going on in front of your eyes. And more than the true understanding, the full experiencing of it. There is no understanding to be had, just a full experiencing it, with all the senses, with all the body, with all the being. Just open yourself to receive, and be open to what that is telling you about yourself. Always, every moment, with every person, is a window of exploration Ito yourself, as you are able to recognize who you are in the eyes of the other person, in the story of the other person, in what that person has inside. Open up to the possibility for things to be not as you want them to be. Open up to the possibility of accepting everything just as it is. There is the magic. That is the pathless path. It has always been here, just below your feet, in every moment. Take out the shoes of the understanding and open up the feelings and sensations that come just from putting the feet in the ground and receiving what is already there. Everything that needs to be is already. Open up to the experiencing of that as a manifestation of the infinite love that is ever present inside each corner of reality. Each atom is a manifestation of that love.\n\n· · ·\nI can’t write about what it feels to be awake, I’m not there yet, and maybe I’ll never will. Who knows. I’m forgetting about that constant willingness to be in a particular place, and connecting every day more with what is already here. I can’t write about what it is to be awake, but I can write about how life is when you want it desperately. When you really want to get out of Dukkha, because it hurts. The constant seeking feels like having the head on fire, and the only thing that you want to find is a pond on which to relieve that pain. And you are in the middle of the desert, and it feels that you will never find that pond and your head burns and burns and burns. And you really want to get out of it. You really want to happen. And then someone tells you that the only way in is trhgouh. The only thing that you can do for it to stop is stop wanting it to stop. Give up the wanting. Open up to what is there, and accepting it with every atom of your body. Holy shit, what a cosmic joke that is. And it makes all the sense of the world, and every aspect f existence is telling us about it. The more you walk away from something, the clearer it shows up in your existence so that you can face it with all of what you are. It happened to us with the birth of our young daughter, on which we really didn’t want a C section and we wanted it to go as smoothly as it could. But it ended up being a nightmare and we suffered a lot. That is the biggest expression that I have had in my life related to running away from something just to go closer to it, and right now this whole awakening game is becoming the same. I travel the world looking for the answers on how to get out of the puzzle, and I don’t seem to reach nowhere. There is clarity inside that the way on which progress will be made is just by giving up the quest, letting the seeker become exhausted, but it has a lot of energy. It truly never gives up, it is very very very persistent, and it is fuuuucking exhausting. But it is becoming more and more clear than it feels very good to give up. To stop seeking. Those small glimpses that have been had on which the tension is relieved and the seeking has stopped are windows of opportunity that talk about how things will look like when there is an absolute allowance for them to be just as they are. This doesn’t mean to be passive and not do anything, it is quite the opposite. It is action with intention, but without bonding to the particular consequence of that action. It is action with the freedom that comes from not being attached to what happens afterwards. It is action from a place of love, not from a place of ego. It is action from a place of wanting to express, not from a place of wanting to be seen. It doesn’t matter if someone sees you, what matters is that it is out there. That is the beauty of this thing, and I come back to what was written at the beginning of this day, about modern technologies and platforms being kind of a one way repository of material, on which you set something free out there and people can interact with it without giving you direct feedback on what did they bring into their world. We are creating something like a parallel reality, on which we can throw out all of our unconscious in there and leave all of what we are for the material one. The internet is the place where we become free of everything that we are not, so that we can be everything that we are in the open space of how we interact with the human beings that live in the place where we have decided to live our life.\n\nBy allowing yourself to be creative just for the sake of it and share it with the world through the internet, without caring about the consequences of it, you open up to the possibility of freeing yourself from what is inside. Enjoy that. It is amazing. Become free of the consequences of your actions. Just do them because it feels good.\n",

But maybe I\\u2019m saying this because part of my unconscious wants that attention, I don\\u2019t know.

Each of us is a witness of the own demons that run through the mind of that person, and in the understanding of that as. A reality there is a freedom that comes.

This whole experience and every one of them will be an exploration into that truth, and how each of our individual human expressions are the means by which it is expressed in the world. It is a window into the marveling for that. About that. Let yourself be in awe, full of wonder, because each moment that exists is a present.

In the morning I was talking to a colleague and she told me about how scarce it is to have people that are willing to hold space. To just hold space for things to happen. And that\\u2019s crazy, because for me it is such a natural thing, that I never stopped for a while to realize how valuable it is. If she hadn\\u2019t told me, I would have taken it as a must, as something that is present in the human experience per se, and it would have gone like that. But because she told it to me, I came into the realization that yes, it is something scarce, it is something valuable, and I see myself and what I do differently after that realization. So the invitation that I\\u2019m making to you as I bring this story up is for you to realize what is that value in you that you are not being able to see.

All of this is information, it is what will help you to realize that you are not the only one that pushes himself down. You are not the only one that thinks that she is not enough. It happens to all of us, and in the acknowledgement of that there is a collective power that can be unleashed. It is very common in our modern society to spend a long time comparing our experience with the one of others, and what that brings is a difficulty in being truly happy for other person\\u2019s success. That is something that happens, and it is something that we need to acknowledge so that we can move on with the integration of what were the means that created this as a consequence. Then we were young we were conditioned to believe that our success is determined by the scale that we hold in a particular range of people. If I have better grades, I\\u2019m more capable at X than the person that is next to me. That comparison is horrible, it creates a lot of hard, and it is one of the things that will be evolving throughout the Yeats. It is quite obvious right now that the way out is not being independent and having the best grades in class, but being interdependent and finding solutions with each other. I was never told truly how to work as a team, and it is something that I lack completely. But it doesn\\u2019t need to stay there forever, because as soon that it is realized as a consequence of what has happened, I\\u2019m able to break free from it as a conditioning.

Just taking care of that moment, and fully being the music. SO much learning and value as been derived from al of that experience. It is felt as a massage to the brain, as a breaking free of throughs, or more than breaking free from throughs, it is about breaking free from the necessity of controlling them. Just letting them flow freely through the whole system, and now there is a willingness present of just enjoying it.

One day I will build up the space for us to grow vegetables. It is always related to the future, and how I will be able to control the future in order ro have a beetter life. Always that life conditioned to what can happen afterwards, not what is happening now. That is part of what is being brought up in this process, and it is brutal to be a true witness of that.

Always dancing in that limbo, but eventually grasping towards the balance.There is knowledge about where that balance is, about where it has been all the time. It is there, inside, waiting for me to realize it and embrace its location. Closer than close. That is the place where the pond of the mind stops having ripples and it becomes clear, transparent.

This ends up being the same as that game of self inquiry dyads, of prompting the other person \\u2018Tell me who you are\\u2019, and just letting that person report what comes up. So this is me reporting whatever comes up in this process of trying to write about what it feels to awaken. I don\\u2019t really know how it feels to awaken, it seems like I will be all this lifetime running behind something that runs much faster than me, but I can certainly tell you how it feels to run and run and run and not reach it. It is exhausting, but at the same time fulfilling. There is a deep sense that there is nothing more important to do than this. That there is nothing more important than knowing the truth. How could anything be more important than knowing the truth? There is a deep wondering of how can this not be as true for other people as it is for the one that is writing this words with his 10 fingers.

Each thing that happens throughout your lifetime is a window of exploration into everything that has ever been, and everything that will ever be.

How would the relationship with it evolve because of that ceasing? What a nice exploration that is. Stop running and let it just be. That is the key, to stop running. To realize more and more all those times that there has been someone running, and just make it conscious for it to stop. There is no need for you to be running, there is only a need for you to be. A need that comes from within, so that the deepest layers of who you are can be expressed through each action that your being goes through. Each action, each moment, is a window into eternity. How do you want to be remembered? As eternity itself, and for that, you need to forget who you are. You need to lose yourself into what you are doing, and the way into that is not trying. It is just doing. Every action is an exploration into the power of just doing. Just do. Just explore.

I travel the world looking for the answers on how to get out of the puzzle, and I don\\u2019t seem to reach nowhere. There is clarity inside that the way on which progress will be made is just by giving up the quest, letting the seeker become exhausted, but it has a lot of energy. It truly never gives up, it is very very very persistent, and it is fuuuucking exhausting. But it is becoming more and more clear than it feels very good to give up. To stop seeking. Those small glimpses that have been had on which the tension is relieved and the seeking has stopped are windows of opportunity that talk about how things will look like when there is an absolute allowance for them to be just as they are. This doesn\\u2019t mean to be passive and not do anything, it is quite the opposite. It is action with intention, but without bonding to the particular consequence of that action. It is action with the freedom that comes from not being attached to what happens afterwards. It is action from a place of love, not from a place of ego. It is action from a place of wanting to express, not from a place of wanting to be seen. It doesn\\u2019t matter if someone sees you, what matters is that it is out there. That is the beauty of this thing, and I come back to what was written at the beginning of this day, about modern technologies and platforms being kind of a one way repository of material, on which you set something free out there and people can interact with it without giving you direct feedback on what did they bring into their world. We are creating something like a parallel reality, on which we can throw out all of our unconscious in there and leave all of what we are for the material one.

          "raw": "\nThis whole game that I have been describing through my writing is very related to the word truth. To bring about the truth of your being into your awareness, so that from there you can be free. And a big element of the human experience that is present right now for me is the capacity, or the tendency, or whatever it is for us to not trust in ourselves enough so that we can share our voice, the unique thing that we bring. It is so easy to hide ourselves behind the willingness to do something good, but not be able to open up to share it because your truth feels weird It doesn’t feel what people have been used to hear from you, so it feels weird to do it. It is always that voice inside the head that is telling yo that the work is not good enough, that you are not worthy of attention from those who want to listen. And this game of awakening is waking up to that truth also, to the truth that it doesn’t really matter, because the creative process itself is not dependent on what people think directly. You do your thing, and then you share it. There may be an aspect of feedback that transforms what you are doing as you are doing it (I’m taking right now about a musician on stage that decides to do something different because of the crowd giving some particular feedback about it), but in that case, the feedback is being used constructively for the artist to evolve what she is doing. It is food for the creation that is taking oplace, not something that pushes it down. And that is where I’m trying to get at here, that food for creation can be sometimes constructive or descrutctive, depending on the way on which the artist receives it. And the more connected you are to the source, the less damage this feedback does to you in a destructive way, because you create from a place different than that which worries about people not being happy with what you do. That is part of the game of awakening the truth, to your truth…. Realizing the game of creativity and how it is played, as you become more and more free of the conditioning that you have to please the people that you create for.\n\nWho do you create for in the first place? That is the question that should be asked. Who is the receptor of your creation? What comes to mind right now is the story about Vincent Van Gogh (or a painter like that), who sold just 1 painting throughout his life in the equivalent of 16 euros of now, and then lately died because of a disease without knowing anything about the success that he will have later. But he was true, he was doing his thing for something more than fame or fortune. He was doing it from a deep place of within, which enabled him to have a particular artistic expression that was unique to who he was. Perhaps his unique expression was not related to selling his paintings, or becoming famous in any way, but it is like that, he was able to find means to express it in a different way, and his mark is there. Was he worse because he didn’t have the recognition of the public, feedback, when he was alive? No, not at all. He created something so unique, so perfectly his, that he was recognized by it afterwards, and his ego did not become attached to what he was creating in the sense that it would if he new that people were paying attention.\n\nThat is something very interesting about this internet age, how in many cases the important thing is the ideas that are behind the person, more than the person itself. It you are able to convey something that appeals to people and resonates with them, there is no need for you to be you. The internet doesn’t care about that. That whole structure of who you have been is that, a construct, which does not need to be in place for this game to be played. At the end, what do you want people to recognize you for? Do you even want to be recognized r you just want to enjoy life? I put the word or in there, as if they were not complementary concepts. Of course you can be recognized and enjoy life, but I have the feeling that there will always be this small aspect of ego that will not leave you alone. And if you create stuff without labelling it with your name there is a particular kind of freedom, that I, myself, as not experienced completely. Maybe it is time to play the game and start building from there, to see what comes up. To explore the game a little bit and realize how fun it can be to have no name. On having no head. On having no name.\n\nAnd then we get into the difference of a person that has no name and a bot in Twitter for example. How could you tell the difference in the long run of someone that has no name, no personal identity attached and a bot? Is it even a good thing to have no name? What is the relationship of having no name in social media and publishing from that place and awakening to your true nature? All these things are coming from the mind, there is an eternal need inside there that wants to know, that wants to better understand the consequence of what it does so that it can control better the outcomes. And that is the eternal game of the ‘what could happen if…?’. There is no way out of that game, because there is a fundamental impossibility of knowing if action is not taken. The only way to know is to take action, is to do the thing. It is to bring it out from the mind and into the world, which is another aspect of mind, but one that is shared. There his the internal aspect of the mind that is the one that goes running and running in circles inside the head, inside myself, and then there is the collective aspect of mind that is where we all are. It is the place where what I do interacts with what you have done and from there both of us evolve in our particular ways into something different that can be completely different from what was happening inside the mind of each of the participants and the movie that was being played inside there. Kopfikno. That is the word. The cinema of the mind. That word has always stuck with me, because it is so true. The mind is always playing a story that s related to its conditioning, to what has gone throughout its life, and from there it is able to try and predict what will happen in the future. We are the best predicting the future, but the worse predictors. Which is the idea of predicting the future? Yes, of course that planning is one of those things, but is it that important to pan? That is something that I wonder a lot, because my father is the best planner of them all. Everything is measured and planned, and it is something that of course has worked for him in his life, but I really wonder if it is something that is condiment to the expression of the soul.\n\nTo the truth.\n\nHow is planning connected to the truth? I plan to sit down and meditate, and I plan that I won’t get up for one hour, until that bell rings. And it ends up being interesting, because from that planning all what arises in the meditation is a consequence of that, and I learn a lot of myself in that process, and I evolve my practice by learning a little more about how to be equanimous, in a energetically and biological way. So that planning is helpful, because I’m able to carve out some time to sit down and just be, so that I can better feel how it feels to be, and bring it about in all my other interactions. That is cool, you know. TO ´be here, writing all this without too much sense, and finding out stories and conclusions about wmyself, about how I relate to reality, about what is important in this game.\n\nI feel now that the best way to do this is by creating an avatar that doesn0t have name, with the story that I wanted to tell about it hidden insid. But I don’t know how to tell stories other than that of myself, so it will be similar to my story. To my quest. I want to share my story beca´use this is how it feels to be a perpetual seeker, to be involved with Dukkha at the bottom of your toes. There is nothing that is enough, and I want to break free. But I even doubt if this is my ego that wants to evolve spiritually, and then go and create stuff under this ego so that the image that the world has of itself is different and cooler. Do I really want the image of myself to be cooler or this is just an exploration into what I want to create? The good thing about creating this whole thing under the image of a creation that doesn’t exist in reality (that whole thing is another creation of the mind, because if this character is built through the internet, and it doesn’t have a human being attached on its name, isn’t it true? Isn’t it real? Of course it is real. And of course that it has a human character attached in its back. I will be there, pulling the strings, until there are no boundaries and the strings become me. Until the hands merge with what is being pulled, and from there, stuff starts happening. It is nice to hide behind my face and hide behind the fact that I say that I’m being truthful with my truth, but is is hard to give up the identification of that truth with me. That is the step that I feel that needs to be taken now, the full dissolving of my identity in the way that I speak about awakening. I need to become free from the attachment of my ego of ‘wanting to be awake’. That’s what Jed McKenna did with his book. He wrote it from a perspective of someone that is not actually present there, probably because of the consequence that writing that book would have on the perspective on which he saw himself, and other people saw himself also. There is beauty, there is value, on breaking free of the identification with what people think about you, and in creating from that place. Van Gogh created from a place of pure expression, and what remains from him is just his art. Nothing else matters. What he brought to the world is what stays, not who he was particularly. Who he was is translated into everything that he painted, and it that, he freed himself on having to realize who he was, because it was an eternal exploration through what he did. This is similar to just being. You are in the sense the you let yourself be. And the expression of that being ends up being the creation of stuff, just for the sake of it. That’s all of what I have been talking about today, about the consequences of creating just for the sake of it, without attachments to the consequences of that creation. My mother knitted socks, but those creations are fully conditioned to her ego because the only way on which she shares her work is by giving them out as a present, for free, so that people can use them and tell their friends that she was the one that made them. There is always an attachment there related to someone telling that you were the one that did something. What is that attachment is not related to my persona, but for a secondary character that I create in the world and who is in charge of doing something cool out there? I have been sharing consistently through Instagram this week breath work sessions, but it is getting to a point where I don’t know if it is helping me anymore. Of course it helps, because there is information that comes from the fact that I’m able to share my truth with the world, but, do I really need to do it? Is it a step into the transition of opening that is created when you are able to share your truth without wanting to change other people? That is part of my intention while doing what I’m doing there. Explore into the sensations that come. Share my truth. Share everything that I am now, so that people can better understand the point where I am at. Is it necessary? I feel it as doing the due diligence for people to better get me. Do I need to do it? The easier way would be to create for me an account not associated to my name, and create for there. Is that the way forward? I don’t really need to ask this questions to myself, I just need to do it and explore. There are ways on which this can be manifested, and I guess that it is time to do it.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto did his thing without the need of having to be recognized, and it must be freeing to have it done it that way. There must be true value on your name not being attached to your identity. Is that a correct way to put it? I don’t really know which is the relationship of identity and name, what is each of those concepts. I just use them because it feels that it is what needs to be said, but I’m not completely sure about what I’m saying. I’m just saying it. Then I will come back and review, but for now the most important thing for me is to just throw what is present away, report what is present and just be from there.\n\nWhat is present now is a certain willingness in the body to sit down with the eyes closed and stare inside. This last weeks have been brutal in the sense that the internal energy is continuing to build up, and there doesn’t seem to be a stopping of this thing. I wonder when it will explode, because it keeps going up and u. And this here is like my valve of escape, the place on which I come to write about this whole process so that I can have something written for afterwards come and realize how crazy I am. I was. I will always be. I’m crazy and you are too, the thing is that I just acknowledge it. I don’t care pointing myself with the flashlight and saying that I’m crazy, because it doesn’t matter. What is it to be crazy, anyway, more than not meeting the expectations that people have of your behavior. That is being crazy, and there are so many crazy people out there that are not even able to realize it because they want to fit. Trying to fit is like putting your soul in a blender in maximum speed. Trying to fit is acknowledging that there is something in you that wants to be expressed but not having the guts to do it. Trying to fit is spending the precious life force that you have inside in the game of other different than yourself and the people with which you relate. Which is the boundary of the people with which you relate, nowadays, anyway? Is there a boundary? I can create my twitter account and the amount of people with which I relate can grow exponentially, because relating to someone is having an impact in their expression of consciousness, and as soon as I create a piece of content and someone interacts with it, I’m in. I made it. I’m relating to them, in a very deep way. That is the game we are playing here, that of relating to one another in ways that we don’t imagine, in ways that we don’t understand.\n\n· · ·\n\nWhat is this whole thing about? I’m going through that all the time, running around in my mind, realizing the road that I’m in. I don’t really understand. I don’t really know where I’m heading. I’m confused. In some moments it feels like I have complete clarity on the way that I’m doing progress, and on other moments there is no clarity at all. I don’t know where I’m going. But my heart knows. What if I left the doubts behind and I just pushed forward with it. Why do I need to run in circles without having feedback from the world? Isn’t having feedback the nice thing about this? Isn’t learning if it will be useful for someone the whole point of the thing? That’s how it is supposed to work nowadays. You create something, you wait for the feedback to come and then you evolve from there. But what if people don’t understand what you are doing? What happened to Van Gogh? If he had waited for the feedback from the people, where would he have ended? That is the thing. I can spend days searching blindly for feedback, or I just can go for it and bring about something from the depth of my soul. What do I prefer? To be sincere. I prefer to go for it, because that is the work that is being done here. It is about facing the demons with all of what I have. I tend to say that the open source factory was a waste of time, but it wasn’t. It trained me to what I’m doing now. It was the preparation stage for this game. It was what needed to happen before I got to where I am at now. To bringing about all this writing with the consistency and discipline that is needed to build something amazing. The important part is building something amazing. And this maze of words is amazing in and of itself. It is something that if no one comes to it, it doesn’t matter because it helped me to take out what I needed to take out of myself to evolve.\n\nIt is the ever asking of the prompt: Tell me who you are. TELL ME WHO YOU ARE. I yell at myself. Who the fuck are you! I want to know. I really want to know. Show me your real self, your real being. Show me the truth of who you are. Show me the truth of what is hidden behind all this thoughts, all these words, all these smiles to random people in the world, all this willingness to explore what it means to be alive, all these different creations that have come about in the last years, from polishing pieces of wood for people to paint on them to creating random websites to do the work. To show up and do the work. That is the thing, doing the work. That’s why I’m here, for doing the work. Until I don’t realize that, I won’t be free. It is time to be free. I will be free. The only way in is through, and in this case, through is into the work. Into every word that show up itself. Into every concept, every image, every process that shows up through these words. The information is all here. This is magic. It is so easy for me to think that it is easy to show up and write 7000 words in one day. It is no easy. It is so easy for me to think that it is easy to show up. It is not. Most people don’t show up because they don’t care enough. I care. I care more than more. Awareness is closer than close, and I care more than more. The world is fucked up, and it is time to wake up. It is time to Do The Work. You may ask, what is Doing The Work? It is showing up to stare at yourself deeply. It is using the tools that we will develop in the DAO as the means of exploring who you are as deep as you can.\n\nThe ancient yogis showed up within themselves and were able to explore their consciousness by developing techniques over and over again, for thousands of years. We don’t have that time right now, it is time for us to wake up. It is time for us to gather up forces as a collective and evolve together, helping each other in the process. It is time for us to develop the transformational journeys that will take us to the other side. Iterating. Learning from mistakes. Together. Developing a timetable of 21 days on which each day will have specific things to do, to Do The Work. DTW. It is almost like DFW, the one that kickstarted this whole thing for me. My mentor, and he didn’t know it. With his book The Infinite Jest, he kickstarted the whole thing. Now the letters are coming back. DTW is kind of the same than DFW and I didn’t realize that until now. Do The Work. David Foster Wallace. I’m going to make sure that your legacy is not wasted, David. We will find a way to treat and cure depression together. Now is the time. I’m creating a time machine on which more and more people will get in, and become transformed. Something huge is starting, and this is the beginning of it.\n\nDo The Fucking Work. Maybe that’s what the F means. DTFW. David The Foster Wallace. Do The Fucking Work. It is time to do the work. Show up. What I’m creating is for you to realize that it is time to do the work. They all say it. They all mean it. It is is the pattern that is repeating itself over and over again, everywhere. I’m tired of looking at it from the distance, not realizing that I’ve got to do the work also. I also have to show up for myself, for my family, for all of those that will be part of this thing. For all the ones that will come next. I won’t be the main engineer of Space X, or developing the ultimate artificial intelligence for Tesla. Nope, that is not my thing. My thing is to help those incredible humans polish their mind as much as they can so that they can come up with the most amazing ideas. Each of the persons that is going to be part of the cohort can come with an idea, with something that they are working on, and the other guys will have to create together a solution for that thing. That is the whole game. The ultimate creativity, building something for each other, to help each other in their own game. That is what the internet is about, and it is important to realize the different personalities that every human being has so that something can be built having that in mind. Each person has something to add to the other, and in the opening to that possibility there is amazing wealth to be built.\n\n    That is the game that is being played in here, by deepening the relationship that each person has with itself. We need to be more creative than ever, and the only way in is through. The only way into that creativity is by exploring deeper and deeper into who each human being is, so that the connection with the source can be established more clearly. With less interference. That is where the magic comes from, from that connection. From touching the alchemical gold and being transformed through that process. By showing up and building a space for people to do that, things will change. We will go through that together. In the Samadhi Center retreat, we had 2 periods of 2 hours of meditation. In this transformational journey, we will have 2 periods of 2 hours of deep creative work, from which our true nature will arise. How do you define deep creative work? That is a very good question, and it is ought to be explored in the future as this project gets more complex. The important thing now is to build cohort 1, which will be the one that will set up the tone for the whole thing. Which is the one that will start building the internet of the future, the way on which we relate to us and each other together. Something amazing will come up from here. It doesn’t matter if we are the only ones, we will be there pushing it forward. Exploring what happens from there. Life is an invitation into a constant iteration into what works and what doesn’t, that is how we learn. That is how nature evolves. Trial and error. Trial and error. We are here for that. That is where the fun is. Do The Work, makes mistakes and digest what happened so that you can evolve from there. There are no failures, only misinterpretations of what was valuable in the experience that you went through. It is all about perspective. Everything boils down to perspective. Realize that and be free of wanting things to be different from what they are. They are what they should be, they are as they should be, and they have always been. That is the magic of this whole thing, that each of us has at hand the means for dong their best. The means for realizing that everything is at its hand.\n\nAnd I am the first one that needs to realize that, because I’m in charge of this project. It is my duty to build it as cool as I can, and if I keep pushing me down for not being enough I won’t end up anywhere. What do I need to have the trust in myself that is needed to use down? The understanding that resistance will always ne there. That’s what this guy speaks about in the book The War On Art. Steven Pressfield. He speaks about the restistance as that mighty enemy that won’t let you be free. It will never let you be free, so you’ve got to learn how to deal with it. It is part of being a human being. So the thing is to move forward with it and enjoy the ride. It is to push through that resistance and overcome it by just sitting own and do the work. Which is the important work that I’m doing right now? Just showing up and writing this. Trusting that it will bring about what I need so that I can evolve in this amazing world that we live in. Everything that I need is already here, I just need to trust it enough. Surrender and trust are about showing up and doing the work, and letting life do its thing. And its thing is whatever happens next, the important thing is to have the perspective in place so that I don’t feel that there is something against me. There is nothing against me. There I only a collection of experiences that is going on and is part of it, it will always be part of it, no matter what happens, so what I can do is just accept it as part of reality and move on from there. With trust. With love. The important thing is to do the work so that day after day I’m better able to love myself a little bit more. Only a little, that is all what is needed. Step by step. And there will be hard days, this thing is not easy. But always remember the resistance, and how it will always conspire agains our creative self because it wants to be sfe. And creating stuff is not safe, because you are exposing yourself. You are showing to the world what you are, everything that you are, and it can be brutal. It is crazy not to have walls built around your experience. It is crazy to be open. We are not used to it, but it is what it is. It is what needs to happen for us to evolve. Everything must be open, available, so that we can evolve from there. It is time to be transparent, as a wall of glass, so that the light can shine from deep within.\n\n    My mission is to be there for all of those who are lost. For all of those who don’t see the way out. For all of those that are depressed and haven’t found help anywhere. For those who have realized by the use of psychedelics that there is a world within that they did not know it existed, and that want to go deeper into the exploration of that world. My mission is to kindle a light into the soul of this people, so that they can feel that they are not alone. This universe that is being built is a beehive on which each of us will be the bees that will bring the nectar of the soul into our queen, our beloved mother. It doesn’t matter if you hate your mother, there is an aspect within yourself that craves for connection to her, to the feminine, to Mother Earth. Call it as you wish, but that will be our queen in this beehive. And each of us will go and tap to the infinite source by Doing The Work. By being part of this collective, you will realize that you are not alone. Not by talking nonsense that will never get you anywhere as the best diet, or the best practices to get better sleep, or whatever. The mission of Dukkha is to help you realize that that information is already there, and you don’t need it in here. What you need is a place to connect with yourself, through the connection with others, and with that, be able to have better relationship with all of those aspects of your life that you want to put energy in. The less time you spend in the discord server, the better, because an important part of Doing The Work is realizing that The Work is done everywhere, all at once. In wherever situation you are in, there will always be an opportunity to do the work. So we come here and develop this intensive program so that we can better understand what we need to do to do the work, but it is nothing more than that. We practice the practices here within Dukkha so that the fog is lifted, so that we can go to our life without that fog and share with every situation all of who we are, all of who we have always been. Each 21 program will teach you how to lift up the fog. How to stay present. It will give you different tools for developing a relationship with yourself that will enable you to give your best in every situation. And then you will come back here to do it again. This is an ongoing process, and what is going to happen in each journey is just the starting point of it. What comes next is the work that you will do in every aspect of your life to recognize how that aspect is helping you to become more fogged, and then being able to recognize that you will get into the realization on how you need to act so that fog is not up again. It is an ongoing process of being a witness to the fog, and realizing that the fog is not you. You are what is behind the fog, what has always been there. No matter if your eyes are open or close, you are always there. That is the key realization, which will bring you to a state of non resistance, of flowing with things just as how they are. This non resistance will open up the avenues for your true self to express itself through every one of your actions, and this is what lifting the fog is all about. Realizing that you are much more than the fog, than those constant, pathological thoughts, and letting your creative genius free That is all what you need to evolve, to bring about your best work. TO shine. Lift the fog and you will shine. The sun is not reaching your inside because of the fog. Start being aware of your breathing and lift it up. It will feel amazing. It will feel more you the n ever. That is the cool part. Doing The Work feels amazing. It is a sensation of freedom that connects you with the core of your existence, and that is something that is foreign to you if you haven’t experienced before. If you hadn’t open that window before. But it is not about you, most of us have not been able to open that window, and that is why we are here, to help each other to become free of the window. To travel into another aspect of the being, which is based on a pure connection with all what is. Not what has been, or what will be, but just with what is. And that is the cool part about this thing, that there is nothing more here than what already is here, so there is actually nothing o be changed, more than your tendency for wanting things to be different. That is the only problem. Our lack of acceptance of how things truly are. As soon as you become free of that wanting to control that part of your life, the rest will take care of itself alone. It willl start resonating in a differen way, you will start resonating in a different way, and from there on there is no way back. It will be scary, it is fucking scary for me, right now as I write I feel very weird movements of energy throughout my body, mainly in weird areas of my brain, but I know tat I just need to push through it. To trust and know that everything will babe ok. But there is my primordial heart of ceasing to exist, of forgetting who I am, of learning my family behindnd. I know that all this fear is coming from the mind but, who am I? What is the mind? Are these words being written by the mind of by me? That is the question that goes through my mind a lot, and nob writing it down is an exploration into th answer by just pointing a torch into that aspect of myself that is always questioning and wanting to know. The mind wants to know. My mind wants to know it all. I want to indulge deeply into every conversation that Lex Fridman has had with the most amazing humans run the world, so that I can know more about this amazing experience called life. But I fucking can’t. It is impossible, at least now, so it is time to make peace with that fact and move on. I kind of feel that I have been able to make peace with that fact, but I’m not sure yet because it is coming up now. I guess that part of that existential fear is related to not being able to do everything that I would like in my lifetime. Being more with my family, writing more, reading more, listening to more music, more, more, more. Everything is more. Why do we always want more, and not less? When is the moment that the shift is made when the realization that comes is that less is more? That sounds unbelievably valuable, specially in this day and age. Less is more, believe it until the core of your being. If you want to indulge all day long into different content, have in mind than the biggest investment that you can do in your lifetime is realizing that less is more. Wisdom and happiness are in another place. Open your eyes.\n\nWho am I talking to? I have realized that most of the time I’m talking to myself, because I realize that huge part of me that wants this to be over. That wants the seeking to be over. That’s why I talk to myself, because I know that someday someone will find value on reading all the struggle that I have gone through inside my own mind. You are not the only one, my friend, there are plenty of us that have gone through this whole process. You are not the only one. It is a natural part of being alive, it is the journey that we sign up for as we jump into the experience of becoming. And it is the mystery also. The magic. The way ahead. I’m paving the road for you to walk it afterwards. Or maybe paving is not the best analogy, maybe I’m just cutting through the noise with my machete. Cutting through all the noise of the mind, bringing it all out so that what remains is just stillness. Not more noise. Only stillness. The only way in is through, and I’m opening the path so that for you it is easier to go through. Establishing an environment through which you can walk and with that evolve into what you came here to be. And have always been. Opening the bushes, shattering the noise into thin air so that clarity can come forth. That is what is needed. The clarity of the pond not being moving because of incessant thoughts. The clarity that comes when there are no more thoughts, the clarity that comes when everything stops and time ceases to exist. That is what shows up when time ceases to exist. The timeless. The open void of non-movement. What remains when there is no more movement? Only you, but without the you. Just pure awareness. That which has always been bringing in reality through each of your senses.\n\nEach sense of your body is a window into the world, an interface towards it, and it can’t be shut down. What can be shut down is your identification with that interface, so that you can realize that you are way beyond that. Closer than close. If I open my eyes, awareness is there, receiving what comes in from the senses. If I close my eyes, awareness is still there, receiving something different because the input signal is different. But it is still there. What does remain behind that? I always tend that awakening is ‘viewing’ in a different way, always associated with sight in any way. But there is a fundamental shift that will take place when I realize that awakening is not related to the sense of sight, nor it is related to the sense of hearing, or touching, or tasting, or smelling. It is beyond each of these inputs, it is beyond what theis interface brings into it. Each sense of the human body is just an input in the computer, but: What is behind the computer? Which is the operative system of this computer? I don’t even understand if that is a proper analogy, but I just say it to find any meaning in there to get a finer grasp of this thing. To be better able to explain it. But how can I explain it if I don’t really know what I’m talking about? What is going on in here? Just pure noise, the mind makings its appearance and trying to grasp into something to swhich it can’t really grasp, building up concepts and ways of explaining that which can’t be explained. Which is the goal of that? Continue with the game of division, of separation, from which it feeds itself. The mind is a machine that is fed by this game of separation, and as soon as I’m able to realize that more clearly I will move towards a better iuundefstanding of what it means to be free. I just want to be free. I want to break free. When I say that, who is the ‘I’ that is writing it? Who is the one that wants to break free? Is it the ego that is highly spiritualized and that wants to become something? Is it the mind that continues to believe that the way on which it will realize its true nature is by realizing that it is just a concept that does not have any solid existence? This whole game is a maze, and I’m deeply into the mazer, not really knowing how to get out. I guess that all these words are like the small crumbles of bread that I’m throwing at the floor as I go deeper and deeper into the maze,so that I can get out afterwards without becoming crazy. All these words are the means by which I help myself to get out after I realize that there is nothing that can be understood. I know that in a conceptual level, but a big part of me wants to know. Is that part getting bigger or smaller as I write these words? Is it becoming stronger or weaker? Is it more present or more absent?\n\nI guess that a big gauge that can help answer those questions is what happens after all these writing sessions, as I go back to relate to the people with which I interact in a daily basis and become who I am by relating to them. There is a big feeling inside that there has been a strong evolution in that relationship, as I open more and more to accepting them for who they are. I go to my parents house and I’m more able to see them for who they are, realizing that they are not the patterns of action that trigger me, they are way beyond that. I go to my grandmothers house and open to the possibility of knowing her for who she is, more than what I want her to be. That is something that is becoming more present day after day: I’m starting to give up the control of wanting people to be different. Even myself. Sometimes I see myself doing things that make me judge me afterwards, and then I realize that it is all a game. It is all the game of the mind, trying to make sense of something that can’t be made sense. And then comes the freedom from that, and a good laughter. A cosmic laughter, that comes from the cosmic joke. The joke of the mental universe, on which I’m always trying to make sense. Always wanting to know. The mind wants to know. I’m the perfect example of that. Perhaps we are all the best example of that, it is just that I have played the game so deeply that I’m very aware about it. And it gets hilarious. The games that the mind play are hilarious. It is time to realize that I’m not those games, and just have fun playing them. Release the inner child that has been with me all my life, and be free from wanting to be someone. Be able to be. Be able to witness who I am with all my deficiencies and just enjoy. With the complexities of what the mind has built, of this whole maze that I have built for myself.\n\nImagine, instead of being just a normal dude working some wood and having a chilled experience, I’m doing my best to build up this DAO (whatever a DAO is) and connect people from all over the world with the intention to awaken the human race. Why couldn’t I be just a normal dude that want’s to do his thing in silence? I can’t. There is a deep need in me related to complexity, to bringing up something more than what is there. And I can’t rest on the feeling of not trying my best to do it. Maybe the next lifetime I will be able to rest a bit more. I don’t know. But for now, it is time to buidl, to create something cool, and to transform the world into something different. I will do my best to understand that there is no need to transform anything, but I do want to help in some way, it is my nature. What I will try to do is not become identified with the consequences of that transformation, but I will try to do something cool. I’m already doing it. It is part of who I am. And it is fun. It will be fun to come back to these writings some day and realize how weird and crazy I was. What the fuck was going on in that mind in that moment. I’m going through the most transformational process of my whole existence, that is what is going on. My daughter is becoming 1 year old in a few days and I feel that there is something that is being unleashed inside me that I can’t understand. But I won’t fight it. It is not worth fighting. What is worth is observing and being grateful for everything that is. For all of what this lifetime has given me. The amazing family that I have, the amazing life experience.\n\nYesterday my mother was telling me about those times on which she was young, and all what was going on inside and around her. She grew up in a farm. And my father grew up in the city. How amazing it is to be able to say that. I have the best of both worlds, and I have not been able to realize it because of this mind constantly making its noise, telling me that I’m behind from where I should be. But it is there, and the only thing that is needed from me is to open my heart and realize everything of what they have to share with me. That is all what is needed. That is the magic. The jungle meets the monastery, the farm meets the city. Everything is merging into something different from everything that we can imagine, and it is time for us to open up the eyes and witness the biggest transformation in human history. Consciousness is waking up to itself, and we are in the front row of that becoming. Of that coming into being.\n\nSo much information out there in the internet, so much going on, and it is time to bring it all together to build something concise that can cut through the noise. It is so easy to get lost in everything that is present. To be lost thinking that A is better than B. This project is about that, it is about exploring different pillars so that the best can be brought up. What is the best really? There is nothing as the best. There is only a perpetual exploration into what is, and the fact that this program is created by the community makes it as powerful as it will be. All of the other programs out there are created by masters and people that have walked the path, but what happens when we are the ones that create the path and hold the space for each other? What comes out of that? This project is an exploration into that. I believe that ‘the best’ is just a way of speaking about what is constantly looking for feedback in order to evolve into something that fulfills its mission in a ever-changing way. What if that feedback is gathered by the community and processed by it? Which are the means that are needed for this feedback to be used in a way that is conducent to something new? Which are the means by which the success of the whole thing will be measured? Is it even necessary to measure something?\n\n· · ·\n\nThe whole point about this thing is to better understand beauty, and how it expresses throughout life. There is a deep aspect within our existence connected to that word, and I guess that this whole exploration into the self and into our true nature is to build a closer bonding towards that word. Towards being able to express beauty in the way on which we relate to ourselves, and from there, to the world. If you are able to relate to yourself in a beautiful way, what will come out from that relationship will bring forth beauty into the expressions that you bring into the world. Each aspect of your being manifests itself in the world through your actions, through every interaction that you go through, and the question that arises is: Why don’t make each interaction a piece of art? I have spoken about every moment being a window into the infinite, into the timeless, into our true self. Why don’t make each moment an exploration into what comes when you are building a piece of art? The thesis is that to exist being in a way different than this demands a higher expenditure of energy, because there is energy that is wasted in the perpetuation of the thought and behavioral patterns that have determined life until this point. As soon as that is freed, there is much more space for stuff to come up from there, and that is where energy starts being available to other processes, and better used. More efficiently. Part of it wasted for running unconscious programs, and that is part of it that is not used for the creative expression of who you are (by definition). Why wouldn’t you do the work of freeing this energy? Because there is a certain momentum that keeps this energy in place and running in the old programs, and setting it free demands a lot of willingness to do it. To Do The Work. And it is unclear what the consequence of Doing it will be, so it is much easier to not do it and stay in the unconscious and conditioned patterns of action. And that is why we perpetuate the way on which ewe do things. An atomic bomb of awareness is required for things to change, and that is where certain practices as breath work, psychedelics or others come in, to help in that process, to shine a light into what is possible so that you can start becoming free of the recursive patterns of action.\n\nI hold the belief that these atomic bombs are needed, because if not it is very hard to realize what is not in place. The mind feels that everything is perfect as it is, and it is unable to realize that there is something that could be waaaay better (and it is very hard to realize this space for betterment(. From the outside it is clear, it is seen, but from the inside the programs are running in circles and getting out of it is very hard. Until there is a collapse, there is a breaking in the system that demand actions, that demands immediate help. That demands a big change in the relationship with the self and the surrounding. Right now, in our society, there are no means for producing that, but there will be more and more, as the tools for discovery of the self get more and more available. And that’s where Dukkha steps in, in the acknowledgment of where we are heading as a society. Psychedelics and breath work will continue to grow in use, there is no doubt about that, but what happens when that door has been opened? Where is that tender hand at the other side that helps people go through the process of **integration** so that they can become what they saw that they could become? The psychedelic assisted therapy is like peeking to the other side of the curtain of what can be possible, and Dukkha’s transformational journeys are the holding of the hand and stepping into the other side with all your potential. Once you have an experience like this, you _know_ that there is something more, and the soul wants to live in there. But it is very easy to come back to old patterns, and from there continue to exists as it has always been. Dukkha will be about helping this people realize a new way of being, with **creativity** as the main focal point of this integration process. Expressing the self through the creation of something new. And on the long term it will be about holding the space for each voyager in this journey. The long term dream is that the person that will go through the journey can take vacation for one month to tap into her true potential, and that month can be paid by other person that just wants the betterment of society. What I have in my soul is the creation of a reciprocal system of payments that enable the cycle to keep on going, Vipassana style. Goenka had a huge fortune that enabled him to create all these physical centers on which to create these retreats, but the retreats that Dukkha will create are more about bringing spirituality into every aspect of life, by integrating the practice into daily life. That’s why it is about 21 days of Doing The Work, because that is the time that science has demonstrated as needed for developing a new habit. It will be about 21 days of building that habit, and realizing the impact that it will have in the life of every person that is part of it. Together. In community.\n\nEach participant of Dukkha’s transformational journeys will come at the other side with a unique approach into her own creative capacity, and that will be extremely powerful in the future of the workforce. Creatives are the ones that are in charge of building the future, and as long as each of us are able to connect to the source in a more direct way we will thrive as a species. I envision people from all walks of life being part of this system, of these journeys, and I envision this 21 days being deeply transformative for all of them. And with the help of all of those who have been part, we’ll keep iterating it, over and over, becoming every day something different, outside of the domain of polarities. It won’t become better or worse, it’ll just become every day. Why have it inside the domain of polarities, that is just what we are trying to avoid in here. This thing is an exploration into what is at the other side of polarities, we are playing with the whole idea of tapping into the non-dual as individuals so that then we can bring that into the way on which we do things (and into what we do). It will be beneficial for the whole project to not talk about polarities, so it is going to be interesting to recognize how duality is expressed in every moment of life, so that you can start making it conscious and with that, using it in a responsible way.\n\nFor example, the first one that comes to mind is the mighty: How are you? That we are soooooo used to ask as we encounter another person. That is the first filler that comes always. So our interaction starts with a polarizing question, and the answer is almost always good. There is almost never a moment to realize how you truly are, to inquiry into the inside and realize truly what is going on in there. How would our relationships look like if we had a commandment from god to wait three seconds to answer that question? What would start coming up? What do we hold inside in the constant answering of ‘I’m good’? What are we suppressing by always answering the same thing? Why do we need to start conversations like that? Is it because of a lack of trust I ourselves? Or what? If I had to choose one of the things that most call my attention in my life right now, it would be this aspect of the interaction between humans. How present this question is, and how shallow it is. And how deep it could be, if we just opened to the truth. This is where the truth comes back, because once you start approaching life in the quest of finding the truth, there is no way back. It follows you, wherever you go, whatever you do. If you answer to that question with the all pervading ‘I’m good, how about you?’, there will always be a voice inside your head telling you: ‘Are you sure that you are feeling good? What is that pressure that you are feeling inside your chest? What is that pressure telling you about how you truly are?’. And there it goes. You won’t get rid of that voice unless you are truthful with your interactions, and as soon as you realize that, and how good it feels to be truthful with your interactions, it is something that you can’t stop. So this whole game of which I’m establishing the guidelines here is an exploration into what it is to be truth. In everything you do. The truth will set you free. The truth will set free the life force that is buried inside every cell of your body, so that it can be used in service of a purpose bigger than yourself. Because you are bigger than yourself, you just haven’t been able to recognize it yet. But you will. We will all do it, with the help of each other, walking next to each other, helping each other navigate it through the paved road. Through the open jungle. Through the skies without fog. Open your eyes and walk through. The only way in is through. Come on in. It feels good in here. It feels true.\n\n· · ·\n\nSurrender to what is, to what has always been, and let life flow through each one of your cells. Open up to the possibility of being a witness of how creation unfolds. Don’t try to control it, you can’t. The more you resist it, the less enjoyable it becomes. Don’t you want to enjoy? Surrender to what is. That is the way in. That is where the magic lies. How to surrender? Just practice. Use each moment as a window that life is giving you as an opportunity to practice a little bit more. Use each breath as an invitation to let go. To be free of controlling. To just be. Learn to just be. But forget the learning part. Just be. Every moment that you realize that you are trying to do something, forger the trying. Just do it. Every moment that you remember that you are breathing, forget the remembering. Just breathe. You will realize that this is the practice, and that each moment is an exploration to deepen the capacity for going within. It is not easy, it s a journey that demands very big amounts of effort, but it will be the most rewarding journey of your life. It is the only journey that you need to take. The journey within. Everything else is just the mind trying to survive, to make its shining appearance. Integrate that, be grateful for it, and just move on. Just being. Doing The Work.\n",

To bring about the truth of your being into your awareness, so that from there you can be free. And a big element of the human experience that is present right now for me is the capacity, or the tendency, or whatever it is for us to not trust in ourselves enough so that we can share our voice, the unique thing that we bring. It is so easy to hide ourselves behind the willingness to do something good, but not be able to open up to share it because your truth feels weird It doesn\\u2019t feel what people have been used to hear from you, so it feels weird to do it. It is always that voice inside the head that is telling yo that the work is not good enough, that you are not worthy of attention from those who want to listen. And this game of awakening is waking up to that truth also, to the truth that it doesn\\u2019t really matter, because the creative process itself is not dependent on what people think directly. You do your thing, and then you share it. There may be an aspect of feedback that transforms what you are doing as you are doing it (I\\u2019m taking right now about a musician on stage that decides to do something different because of the crowd giving some particular feedback about it), but in that case, the feedback is being used constructively for the artist to evolve what she is doing. It is food for the creation that is taking oplace, not something that pushes it down. And that is where I\\u2019m trying to get at here, that food for creation can be sometimes constructive or descrutctive, depending on the way on which the artist receives it. And the more connected you are to the source, the less damage this feedback does to you in a destructive way, because you create from a place different than that which worries about people not being happy with what you do. That is part of the game of awakening the truth, to your truth\\u2026.

That is the question that should be asked. Who is the receptor of your creation? What comes to mind right now is the story about Vincent Van Gogh (or a painter like that), who sold just 1 painting throughout his life in the equivalent of 16 euros of now, and then lately died because of a disease without knowing anything about the success that he will have later. But he was true, he was doing his thing for something more than fame or fortune. He was doing it from a deep place of within, which enabled him to have a particular artistic expression that was unique to who he was. Perhaps his unique expression was not related to selling his paintings, or becoming famous in any way, but it is like that, he was able to find means to express it in a different way, and his mark is there. Was he worse because he didn\\u2019t have the recognition of the public, feedback, when he was alive? No, not at all. He created something so unique, so perfectly his, that he was recognized by it afterwards, and his ego did not become attached to what he was creating in the sense that it would if he new that people were paying attention.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"That is something very interesting about this internet age, how in many cases the important thing is the ideas that are behind the person, more than the person itself.

That whole structure of who you have been is that, a construct, which does not need to be in place for this game to be played. At the end, what do you want people to recognize you for? Do you even want to be recognized r you just want to enjoy life? I put the word or in there, as if they were not complementary concepts. Of course you can be recognized and enjoy life, but I have the feeling that there will always be this small aspect of ego that will not leave you alone. And if you create stuff without labelling it with your name there is a particular kind of freedom, that I, myself, as not experienced completely.

What is the relationship of having no name in social media and publishing from that place and awakening to your true nature? All these things are coming from the mind, there is an eternal need inside there that wants to know, that wants to better understand the consequence of what it does so that it can control better the outcomes. And that is the eternal game of the \\u2018what could happen if\\u2026?\\u2019. There is no way out of that game, because there is a fundamental impossibility of knowing if action is not taken. The only way to know is to take action, is to do the thing. It is to bring it out from the mind and into the world, which is another aspect of mind, but one that is shared. There his the internal aspect of the mind that is the one that goes running and running in circles inside the head, inside myself, and then there is the collective aspect of mind that is where we all are. It is the place where what I do interacts with what you have done and from there both of us evolve in our particular ways into something different that can be completely different from what was happening inside the mind of each of the participants and the movie that was being played inside there. Kopfikno. That is the word. The cinema of the mind. That word has always stuck with me, because it is so true. The mind is always playing a story that s related to its conditioning, to what has gone throughout its life, and from there it is able to try and predict what will happen in the future. We are the best predicting the future, but the worse predictors. Which is the idea of predicting the future? Yes, of course that planning is one of those things, but is it that important to pan? That is something that I wonder a lot, because my father is the best planner of them all.

I want to share my story beca\\xB4use this is how it feels to be a perpetual seeker, to be involved with Dukkha at the bottom of your toes. There is nothing that is enough, and I want to break free. But I even doubt if this is my ego that wants to evolve spiritually, and then go and create stuff under this ego so that the image that the world has of itself is different and cooler. Do I really want the image of myself to be cooler or this is just an exploration into what I want to create? The good thing about creating this whole thing under the image of a creation that doesn\\u2019t exist in reality (that whole thing is another creation of the mind, because if this character is built through the internet, and it doesn\\u2019t have a human being attached on its name, isn\\u2019t it true? Isn\\u2019t it real? Of course it is real. And of course that it has a human character attached in its back. I will be there, pulling the strings, until there are no boundaries and the strings become me. Until the hands merge with what is being pulled, and from there, stuff starts happening. It is nice to hide behind my face and hide behind the fact that I say that I\\u2019m being truthful with my truth, but is is hard to give up the identification of that truth with me. That is the step that I feel that needs to be taken now, the full dissolving of my identity in the way that I speak about awakening. I need to become free from the attachment of my ego of \\u2018wanting to be awake\\u2019. That\\u2019s what Jed McKenna did with his book. He wrote it from a perspective of someone that is not actually present there, probably because of the consequence that writing that book would have on the perspective on which he saw himself, and other people saw himself also. There is beauty, there is value, on breaking free of the identification with what people think about you, and in creating from that place. Van Gogh created from a place of pure expression, and what remains from him is just his art. Nothing else matters. What he brought to the world is what stays, not who he was particularly. Who he was is translated into everything that he painted, and it that, he freed himself on having to realize who he was, because it was an eternal exploration through what he did. This is similar to just being. You are in the sense the you let yourself be. And the expression of that being ends up being the creation of stuff, just for the sake of it. That\\u2019s all of what I have been talking about today, about the consequences of creating just for the sake of it, without attachments to the consequences of that creation. My mother knitted socks, but those creations are fully conditioned to her ego because the only way on which she shares her work is by giving them out as a present, for free, so that people can use them and tell their friends that she was the one that made them. There is always an attachment there related to someone telling that you were the one that did something. What is that attachment is not related to my persona, but for a secondary character that I create in the world and who is in charge of doing something cool out there? I have been sharing consistently through Instagram this week breath work sessions, but it is getting to a point where I don\\u2019t know if it is helping me anymore. Of course it helps, because there is information that comes from the fact that I\\u2019m able to share my truth with the world, but, do I really need to do it?

Share everything that I am now, so that people can better understand the point where I am at. Is it necessary? I feel it as doing the due diligence for people to better get me. Do I need to do it? The easier way would be to create for me an account not associated to my name, and create for there. Is that the way forward?

Why do I need to run in circles without having feedback from the world? Isn\\u2019t having feedback the nice thing about this? Isn\\u2019t learning if it will be useful for someone the whole point of the thing? That\\u2019s how it is supposed to work nowadays. You create something, you wait for the feedback to come and then you evolve from there. But what if people don\\u2019t understand what you are doing? What happened to Van Gogh? If he had waited for the feedback from the people, where would he have ended? That is the thing. I can spend days searching blindly for feedback, or I just can go for it and bring about something from the depth of my soul. What do I prefer? To be sincere. I prefer to go for it, because that is the work that is being done here. It is about facing the demons with all of what I have. I tend to say that the open source factory was a waste of time, but it wasn\\u2019t. It trained me to what I\\u2019m doing now. It was the preparation stage for this game. It was what needed to happen before I got to where I am at now. To bringing about all this writing with the consistency and discipline that is needed to build something amazing.

Each of the persons that is going to be part of the cohort can come with an idea, with something that they are working on, and the other guys will have to create together a solution for that thing. That is the whole game. The ultimate creativity, building something for each other, to help each other in their own game.

That is where the magic comes from, from that connection. From touching the alchemical gold and being transformed through that process. By showing up and building a space for people to do that, things will change. We will go through that together. In the Samadhi Center retreat, we had 2 periods of 2 hours of meditation. In this transformational journey, we will have 2 periods of 2 hours of deep creative work, from which our true nature will arise. How do you define deep creative work?

That is where the fun is. Do The Work, makes mistakes and digest what happened so that you can evolve from there. There are no failures, only misinterpretations of what was valuable in the experience that you went through. It is all about perspective. Everything boils down to perspective. Realize that and be free of wanting things to be different from what they are. They are what they should be, they are as they should be, and they have always been.

It is crazy not to have walls built around your experience. It is crazy to be open. We are not used to it, but it is what it is. It is what needs to happen for us to evolve.

For all of those who don\\u2019t see the way out. For all of those that are depressed and haven\\u2019t found help anywhere. For those who have realized by the use of psychedelics that there is a world within that they did not know it existed, and that want to go deeper into the exploration of that world. My mission is to kindle a light into the soul of this people, so that they can feel that they are not alone. This universe that is being built is a beehive on which each of us will be the bees that will bring the nectar of the soul into our queen, our beloved mother. It doesn\\u2019t matter if you hate your mother, there is an aspect within yourself that craves for connection to her, to the feminine, to Mother Earth. Call it as you wish, but that will be our queen in this beehive. And each of us will go and tap to the infinite source by Doing The Work. By being part of this collective, you will realize that you are not alone. Not by talking nonsense that will never get you anywhere as the best diet, or the best practices to get better sleep, or whatever. The mission of Dukkha is to help you realize that that information is already there, and you don\\u2019t need it in here. What you need is a place to connect with yourself, through the connection with others, and with that, be able to have better relationship with all of those aspects of your life that you want to put energy in. The less time you spend in the discord server, the better, because an important part of Doing The Work is realizing that The Work is done everywhere, all at once. In wherever situation you are in, there will always be an opportunity to do the work. So we come here and develop this intensive program so that we can better understand what we need to do to do the work, but it is nothing more than that. We practice the practices here within Dukkha so that the fog is lifted, so that we can go to our life without that fog and share with every situation all of who we are, all of who we have always been. Each 21 program will teach you how to lift up the fog. How to stay present. It will give you different tools for developing a relationship with yourself that will enable you to give your best in every situation. And then you will come back here to do it again. This is an ongoing process, and what is going to happen in each journey is just the starting point of it. What comes next is the work that you will do in every aspect of your life to recognize how that aspect is helping you to become more fogged, and then being able to recognize that you will get into the realization on how you need to act so that fog is not up again. It is an ongoing process of being a witness to the fog, and realizing that the fog is not you. You are what is behind the fog, what has always been there. No matter if your eyes are open or close, you are always there. That is the key realization, which will bring you to a state of non resistance, of flowing with things just as how they are. This non resistance will open up the avenues for your true self to express itself through every one of your actions, and this is what lifting the fog is all about. Realizing that you are much more than the fog, than those constant, pathological thoughts, and letting your creative genius free That is all what you need to evolve, to bring about your best work. TO shine. Lift the fog and you will shine. The sun is not reaching your inside because of the fog. Start being aware of your breathing and lift it up. It will feel amazing. It will feel more you the n ever. That is the cool part. Doing The Work feels amazing. It is a sensation of freedom that connects you with the core of your existence, and that is something that is foreign to you if you haven\\u2019t experienced before. If you hadn\\u2019t open that window before. But it is not about you, most of us have not been able to open that window, and that is why we are here, to help each other to become free of the window. To travel into another aspect of the being, which is based on a pure connection with all what is. Not what has been, or what will be, but just with what is. And that is the cool part about this thing, that there is nothing more here than what already is here, so there is actually nothing o be changed, more than your tendency for wanting things to be different. That is the only problem. Our lack of acceptance of how things truly are. As soon as you become free of that wanting to control that part of your life, the rest will take care of itself alone.

That is the question that goes through my mind a lot, and nob writing it down is an exploration into th answer by just pointing a torch into that aspect of myself that is always questioning and wanting to know.

I kind of feel that I have been able to make peace with that fact, but I\\u2019m not sure yet because it is coming up now. I guess that part of that existential fear is related to not being able to do everything that I would like in my lifetime. Being more with my family, writing more, reading more, listening to more music, more, more, more. Everything is more. Why do we always want more, and not less? When is the moment that the shift is made when the realization that comes is that less is more? That sounds unbelievably valuable, specially in this day and age. Less is more, believe it until the core of your being.

It is beyond each of these inputs, it is beyond what theis interface brings into it. Each sense of the human body is just an input in the computer, but: What is behind the computer?

The long term dream is that the person that will go through the journey can take vacation for one month to tap into her true potential, and that month can be paid by other person that just wants the betterment of society. What I have in my soul is the creation of a reciprocal system of payments that enable the cycle to keep on going, Vipassana style. Goenka had a huge fortune that enabled him to create all these physical centers on which to create these retreats, but the retreats that Dukkha will create are more about bringing spirituality into every aspect of life, by integrating the practice into daily life. That\\u2019s why it is about 21 days of Doing The Work, because that is the time that science has demonstrated as needed for developing a new habit. It will be about 21 days of building that habit, and realizing the impact that it will have in the life of every person that is part of it. Together. In community.\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Each participant of Dukkha\\u2019s transformational journeys will come at the other side with a unique approach into her own creative capacity, and that will be extremely powerful in the future of the workforce.

I envision people from all walks of life being part of this system, of these journeys, and I envision this 21 days being deeply transformative for all of them. And with the help of all of those who have been part, we\\u2019ll keep iterating it, over and over, becoming every day something different, outside of the domain of polarities. It won\\u2019t become better or worse, it\\u2019ll just become every day. Why have it inside the domain of polarities, that is just what we are trying to avoid in here. This thing is an exploration into what is at the other side of polarities, we are playing with the whole idea of tapping into the non-dual as individuals so that then we can bring that into the way on which we do things (and into what we do). It will be beneficial for the whole project to not talk about polarities, so it is going to be interesting to recognize how duality is expressed in every moment of life, so that you can start making it conscious and with that, using it in a responsible way.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"For example, the first one that comes to mind is the mighty: How are you? That we are soooooo used to ask as we encounter another person. That is the first filler that comes always. So our interaction starts with a polarizing question, and the answer is almost always good. There is almost never a moment to realize how you truly are, to inquiry into the inside and realize truly what is going on in there. How would our relationships look like if we had a commandment from god to wait three seconds to answer that question? What would start coming up? What do we hold inside in the constant answering of \\u2018I\\u2019m good\\u2019? What are we suppressing by always answering the same thing? Why do we need to start conversations like that? Is it because of a lack of trust I ourselves? Or what? If I had to choose one of the things that most call my attention in my life right now, it would be this aspect of the interaction between humans. How present this question is, and how shallow it is. And how deep it could be, if we just opened to the truth. This is where the truth comes back, because once you start approaching life in the quest of finding the truth, there is no way back. It follows you, wherever you go, whatever you do. If you answer to that question with the all pervading \\u2018I\\u2019m good, how about you?\\u2019, there will always be a voice inside your head telling you: \\u2018Are you sure that you are feeling good? What is that pressure that you are feeling inside your chest? What is that pressure telling you about how you truly are?\\u2019. And there it goes. You won\\u2019t get rid of that voice unless you are truthful with your interactions, and as soon as you realize that, and how good it feels to be truthful with your interactions, it is something that you can\\u2019t stop. So this whole game of which I\\u2019m establishing the guidelines here is an exploration into what it is to be truth. In everything you do. The truth will set you free. The truth will set free the life force that is buried inside every cell of your body, so that it can be used in service of a purpose bigger than yourself. Because you are bigger than yourself, you just haven\\u2019t been able to recognize it yet. But you will. We will all do it, with the help of each other, walking next to each other, helping each other navigate it through the paved road. Through the open jungle. Through the skies without fog.

Don\\u2019t you want to enjoy? Surrender to what is. That is the way in. That is where the magic lies. How to surrender? Just practice. Use each moment as a window that life is giving you as an opportunity to practice a little bit more. Use each breath as an invitation to let go. To be free of controlling. To just be.

          "raw": "\nThis book is about Doing The Work. It is a testament that I want to bring into existence as a consequence of having done it myself. It is brutal. I just ended my morning meditation after waking up at 4:44 am, meditating for 1 hour which was eternal because very tough stuff is coming up during it and it makes it hard to go through, and no one is there for telling me ‘congratulations, you did it again’. In this world we are used to getting feedback from it, which makes us feel good. We are used to receive praise, or any kind of external consequence for what we do, but in this kind of game there won’t be something like that. You have to show up for yourself, and it can get quite challenging not to have that external validation. If you don’t validate it internally, how can you keep it up? I guess that my take on that is that this is the point where faith comes in. And maybe faith is another way to speak about that internal fire which moves us towards the unknown. There is something within me that is craving for the exploration of the unknown, there is part of me that _knows_, and that is the part that doesn’t need external reassurance, because it is everything that is. The part of me that calls for The Work is the consequence of it. That part helps me do it, because it knows that the consequence of it is fundamentally different from whatever external validation I could get in 48 lifetimes. There is a knowledge within, which pursues this thing and helps me go through it without needing someone to be next to me telling me: ‘You are doing it right boy, keep it going’. At the end of the day we are alone in this thing, and no one can do The Work for you. That is what you signed up for when you started reading this thing. Just sit. Just sit and ask yourself ‘Who am I?’ Until there is no one asking. Just do The Work.\n\nDukkha is being created to join forces in this quest. I do it on my own because I’m alone, I don’t know enough people, nor have a proper job, on which I can do this kind of thing and be alongside with other people that are aiming to do it. A big part of me wants to belong, to be part of a collective of human beings that are aiming towards the same thing, that are seekers who know the thing and are willing to annihilate themselves in order to experience the truth. I was sitting down and one of the rants on which my mind went today was: ‘So here I am, learning how to die before I die, on my own house, and no one really knows I’m doing this. No one really understands what I’m going through. I can have a major breakthrough in my meditation, something that can transform the way on which I relate to reality, and my wife and baby will wake up the same as every other day, with the same smile, as if it was all how it has been always’. It’s tough to reconcile that. A big part of me wants them to know, wants them to realize how hard I have worked to become a more conscious, loving and clear human being. But the sole fact that I wrote that sentence is part of the root of the thing, because on that trying hard I get lost in it, forgetting to just be.\nI say ‘I have worked hard to become…’ and that is the whole thing that summarizes what I will talk in this book. The thing is aiming to become. Trying to change something that is already there, and will always be there. I can’t become anything, I’m already it, but I’m not able to realize it because of this eternal wanting, trying, aiming to become. I’m always standing in a point and looking to other one, because I feel deeply inside that there is something that needs to be changed. And that won’t let me live in the present, and that won’t let me truly appreciate every moment that goes by.\n\nEverything that I do is for myself, and writing it down here is a means for establishing it as a testament deep within myself. Everything that I do is for myself, because I am the one that wants to know the truth, and experience life from there. I am the one that is tired of suffering because of Dukkha, and it is on me. I am the one that is willing to Do The Work, to pave the road, because I know. If I do it and then everyone feels the same, that is a window to rejoice in the fact that I do it for me. For me to have a clearer perception of who they are, and enjoy every aspect of their being because of that. It is for me, for having a deeper enjoyment of life. I do it for me, and its not fair for anyone that I think of her different because she hasn’t done it. I do it for me, because I am the one that wants to experience the truth. I do it for me, because I am the one that wants to feel the deepest love that has ever been felt. I do it for me, because I care. Because I love life so much that I want to learn how to let it go. How to break free from the attachments from it. Because this is the most important Work that can be done in a lifetime, and it is time to wake up. It is time to realize the true nature of my being, and for that, no one will be there cheering me up, pushing my ass till the top of the hill. Nope, this is a game that is played by oneself alone, it is a quest on which each of us embarks only with the image that comes back from the mirror. No partners here, I’m so sorry. No one to assess you progress more than you, I’m so sorry. Just you and the look in your eyes. Just you and the consequence of each one of your senses inside you. Just you and your memories, and each conditioning that is part of _your_ particular existence. No one can be in your shoes. Never.\n\nYou can spend a whole lifetime trying to explain who you are, who you have been, what do you want to become, but you will never be able to convey it clearer than just by being. That is everything that you are, and it shows up when you are just being. That is the amazing part of this whole game… The more you understand, the more you have to give up doing something particular. Becoming absolutely free is understanding on a experiential level that there is nothing to be done. We are here just to be. We came just to be. You are the only one that knows. You are the shadow that has been following you the whole time. No one can acknowledge that for you. You have to realize it for yourself. You are the one that will wake up. Not me. I can’t do it for you. And the best way on which I can embody everything that I have learned or experienced is by evolving the way on which I relate to the world. Evolving who I am, just by being the way I am. Just expressing from that place of truth. Of my truth. Every one of us has its own truth, and it is time to fully live that reality. Fully accept it. The other day there was an old person waiting for the bus and we took him to the town, and he started talking to us about how god had changed his life, after presenting himself to this person on a turning point of his life, after being a deep alcoholic for 15 years. That moment absolutely changed his life, and he was talking to us about his relationship with god and all what it meant in his life. Every second of his existence was devoted to god. How can I bring my truth into this story and try to change in any way his perception so that he can understand that he IS god. It is not my job, not my duty, and it is perfect as it is. It is perfect. Every deviation from that perfection is a construct of my ego trying to help people when they don’t need help.\n\nThat is such a constant one, wanting to help when I have not been asked to. It is another expression of what I was talking before, because it is the means by which I impose my truth in front of other person’s truth. I think that mine is more true because I have ‘Done The Work’. How qualified am I to say that my work is more important than the one that all the rest of humans have done? I’m no one. It is not something good to do, and here I am acknowledging that and making a little bit more conscious so that I can better understand why, and bring it into the conscious aspect of my being. Because this is a big one. When I was traveling the world, I used to to different places, with different languages, and the first thing that I asked locals how to say in their language was ‘Do you need help?’. That is me, always willing to help. But which is the limit to that? When does it become something that is not helpful because I’m trying to express an unconscious belief that they need my help because they haven’t done The Work?\n\nThat is a great thing about social media right now, the cat that I can post my work openly, and with that, not have to talk directly to one person, and try to change that particular person. No, now I can share it for all of those who want to listen, and not try to change someone particular. Offer the possibility for change to happen, but just for those that want it and will approach. That is an amazing thing of this day and age, being able to do that. I guess it is my responsibility to build up my audience and the people with which I want to work with, because those are the ones that will give me energy and make me feel alive. It is easy for me to underestimate the power that twitter followers can have, but it is major. It is something that is beyond what I think. And it is my duty to be able to share my voice with those that want to listen, and that’s what I’m doing every day by coming here and just sharing it. And going to twitter and just sharing my thoughts. It is an amazing part of Doing The Work, sharing your stuff openly, and realize that the world doesn’t end if it good enough. It is so easy to under appreciate the work that has been done to reach this understanding, but it doesn’t really matter. What only matters is the work itself, each time that is being done.\n\nToday I have my first breathwork session, actually the first online session that I have planed and that I have charged for, and it is a major day in my life. Most of it it has been very hard for me to establish a healthy relationship with money, most of it lately in my life, because of two things:\n\n1. I have been given a lot of wealth because of having been born where I was born.\n2. It is very hard for me to value what I do enough so that I can charge for it.\n\nSo today is a day on which that transitions into something new, because I open up to the possibility of sharing myself with the world. I have been doing it lately, having a different personality in every social media thing, and it is so amazing, I feel so happy and inspired by being that chamaleon that does something different in each one of them. I feel good with it, and creating this breathwork salon today is an expression of that also. I’m giving myself the space for being there for other people. I was just going to write that I was going to help them, but that is not true. I will just hold the space, and they will help themselves, each on her on way. As I said before, the most important part of this whole game is showing up, and this people will do it. Each of the persons that will be part of this thing will show up, and that is the most important aspect of Doing The Work. Showing up. The saying goes: ‘The most important way on which you can help yourself is to learn how to do things when you don’t feel like doing it’. That is the same. The biggest transformations happen when you show up, just because you care. Just because you want to explore what will happen at the other side. Show up. Be there. For you, not for anyone else. You deserve it.\n\n· · ·\n\nWho am I?\n\nThe one that plays the music. The one that feels the music, in the bottom of the flesh. The one that is running the flesh, bringing into life stuff, a lot of stuff in the meantime. I am the clarity that is present when there is not a noise of something that I should be. I’m not what I should be, I am what I am. That’s all. I am the one that is willing to create something new, and see what happens. I am the one that sees off people show up, that realizes if people are willing to show up by creating the space. I am the one that has a hard time sharing his voice, because it doesn’t come across. I am not the one that expects something particular to happen, I am the one that just lets it happen. I am the holding of the space, because I am space itself. How wouldn’t I be able to hold space if I’m space itself! The shivers in my body, the cold that is more present than below the cold shower.\nAll that trying to answer the question who I am rationally. I’m not that. I can only tell what is present right now, and that is a feeling of awkwardness for not having anyone show up in the salon. There is disappointment present, but also a recognition that the work needs to be refined. I have not done my due diligence properly, and I need to level up my game. The way on which I have been communicating is good, I have good ideas and everything, but it is time to level up the game. I need to become unstoppable, and transform all of who I am into value that can be the means by which I do my thing every day. I want to transform the world, and the way into that is understanding how to play the game. The ones that matter understood how to play the game, and it is in that that I will make my way through. I am the one that just wants to play that game, and is learning how to do it.\n\nI am the one that feels melted when no one shows up, and realizes that that is the game that I have been playing. I am the one that is need for putting the feet in the floor, so that I can run truly. I’ll start running. I’m beginning to run, just by showing up to Do The Work. That is all that matters, Doing The Work. Let discipline be the best master. The samurai. Time to get the shit together. From tomorrow, the schedule will be:\n\n8am - video duration - 5min -> Breathing session\n8am -> Live meditation with samadhi center\n9am-13pm -> Deep work writing session\n\nThis will be what happens every day from Sunday to Friday, and with this, I will crush it. Consistency is the ruler of success. That is how I win, just by being consistent and learning how to play the game. Learn how to play the game, that is all that takes. The game of life.\n\nThis is who I am when all the doubts are in play. I start making sense, understanding what happened and fixing the stuff so that in the future it won’t happen again. It’s just what it is. I am what is behind all these doubts. I am the one who trusts.\n\nI JUST WANT TO BE A HUMAN BEING, AND EXPERIENCE HOW IT FEELS.\n",

There is a knowledge within, which pursues this thing and helps me go through it without needing someone to be next to me telling me: \\u2018You are doing it right boy, keep it going\\u2019. At the end of the day we are alone in this thing, and no one can do The Work for you. That is what you signed up for when you started reading this thing. Just sit.

          "raw": "\nToday I’ll start talking about holding space, and the learnings that come as a consequence of doing that. Yesterday I had a huge one. I organized an event and very few people showed up, which had me very disappointed throughout the whole event because I felt that I had a responsibility with the person that I invited to be the co-host, and the main responsibility that I felt had with her was an economic one. I thought that because of there being very few people, she would get little money, and her time would not be worth it. And there was also the presence of being a failure in the way that I shared what I was going to do, since I was not able to reach out to people properly through social media. But the persons that participated were amazing, they are the most important people for me in the world, and it was very important to share that vulnerable space with them. My wife and the best friend that I have in the world were there. But yes, my capacity for holding the space was compromised because of me having been thrown out of balance for what I felt in that moment. So I was just feeling those sensations and what was brought up for me, through the whole experience. It was important.\n\nAnd then I went to my parents house, and because of a question that my father made to me (‘How many people were there?’) I realized that I have a strong subconscious pattern of thought that is related to the amount of people participating in something equalling how good it is. The more, the better. This has been present throughout my life, as I have had a very large group of friends, have gone to travels with a lot of people, always more and more and more. Thinking that more is the key. I sit down to work and I think that the more hours I put in the better, not realizing that there is a subtle aspect that is working that is way beyond this number. Last night I had a conversation with only one friend and it was very important, very profound, very nice. This is what matters, having this type of interaction. It doesn’t matter with how many people. But it was there, working its way, and yesterday I was able to spot it right on. It was absolutely freeing to be the witness of that process, of that unconscious process. That is what all this game is about, of making the unconscious aspects conscious. And that was a big one. I was able to realize that and become free of it. I don’t mean that it won’t be active and I won’t value my life based on numbers anymore, but at least it is not as present as it was before. And I want to hold space. I want to be there for others. And if I’m there holding the space being disappointed because no more people showed up, I won’t be able to do it fully, with all of what I am. And I want to be able to do it fully. So that’s why it is so important to have realized this, because it will happen again. There will be another time on which I will organize stuff and people will not show up. It has happened, and it will happen.\n\nAnd in that moment, what will I decide? To give my best for those who are there, or to blame myself for not having more people in?\nThe answer is clear as water today. And that is what showing up is for. I created this space, I organized something new, that didn’t exist before, and I showed up for it. I did it because I care. And life answered back with one of the most important realizations that I have had lately, because this is one that constitutes the way on which I work as a human being in society. There is the important concept of traction, and it is impossible to be hosting an event for 100 people from scratch. It is not necessary. What is necessary is to forget about the number, and make it a memorable experience for all of those who are there. For all of those that did show up. My time, their time, is so valuable that it is not worth it to spend it thinking about what could have happened if more people showed up. No, no, no. It is absolutely worth spending with the people that are there, giving their best, pushing it through.\n\nIt is more than ever with this type of work, which requires a compromise from the people that participate. It is not easy. It is not free. You have to Do The Work. And people don’t like to be challenged, not too much. It is tough. So this thing will happen again, and it is going to be very important to be able to realize how the ego is playing his thing, how it is working in those subtle ways so that I can become present with what is in that moment. That is the energy that needs to be moving, and that is the work that I’m going to do as I move towards the understanding of how to truly hold space for the transformation of others. I need to open up to do more things like this. I need to be there for more people as they transition into a new way of being. And it starts here. It starts in every session that I go through, in every moment that I decide to show up for other people. There is a strong need inside me of what it means to hold space, and to take that absolutely seriously, having in mind all the aspects of what it can be. It is not a trivial thing, it is not something that should be taken for granted, and it is important. And the only way to learn how to do it better is just by doing it. Is just by showing up. It is just by creating this stuff and making it happen that life will give this treasures to my journey of discovery of who and what I am.\n\nBecause this way of behaving constitutes me. It is a huge part of me. It is time to integrate it and move forward without it. Because the festival that will be hosted in February as the launching event for the DAO will be the same. It doesn’t matter how many people show up. What matters is the energy of it, and what will happen there. And I’m in charge of that. It will be a retreat of deep work and deep rest. It will be a retreat on which we will transform our beings through the power of sharing with each other, with nature, and with all of what we are. And the only way to do it wholeheartedly is to forget about the caring of how many people will show up. And this is only achieved if there is a true disconnection between the event itself and the capacity of learning money because of how many people show up. That whole thing needs to be disconnected, so that there is no problem in any way if 10 people show up, or 200. What needs to happen is that people have to bring their own stuff, and it has to be everything self-sustaining. Like burning man. Everyone brings their own stuff, we just gather there and see what happens from the experience. But there is not a central authority that is deciding what will happen. I’m just in charge of the music, of finding people that are willing to play their music, or if not, I’m in charge of creating the playlist that will be running if there is no people that is willing to play their music. It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters more than the opportunity to gather to celebrate what is being built through the writing of this document. This is all what is. This is the important part. Because the movement that is starting now is powerful, it will have an impact, and is the energy that is moving through me. I have to be fit for service. I have to be strong. I have to be the best version of myself, and that is not a static thing. It is the consequence of being able to show up, and use every opportunity that life gives me to realize better which are my biases, and who am I really. What do I really bring into the world. The only way to explore those questions is to come out of my comfort zone, and explore them in the wilderness. Out there in the wild. Where people are good, and also bad. Shield myself from what is not helpful, and become in the process. Use every interaction that life offers a tool for deeper exploration, for deeper playing of this game. Learn to recognize the signals. Be there for them and show up. Just show up. That is all that matters. The learning comes from there, and it is more subtle than what I think. The unconscious mind is working on the background, there is no need for me to control that process. But I need to show up, in order to have it up and running.\n\nThat is what this whole game of evolution is about. It is about interacting with the world, getting feedback, and learning how to play the game better. It is giving and taking. It is helping and being helped. On Wednesday I will start a huge adventure in that sense, and I will give my best to stay focused and realize that I have everything that is needed to provide my family with all of what they need. To be free from the burden of dependence from my family in economic terms. And more than that, to have people to believe in what I do, and help them become who they can be. That is my mission here, to shine a light into other people so that they can be the best version of themselves. That is all that matters, and I’m here for that.\n",

It is not a trivial thing, it is not something that should be taken for granted, and it is important. And the only way to learn how to do it better is just by doing it. Is just by showing up. It is just by creating this stuff and making it happen that life will give this treasures to my journey of discovery of who and what I am.\"}),`\n`,(0,o.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Because this way of behaving constitutes me. It is a huge part of me. It is time to integrate it and move forward without it. Because the festival that will be hosted in February as the launching event for the DAO will be the same. It doesn\\u2019t matter how many people show up. What matters is the energy of it, and what will happen there. And I\\u2019m in charge of that. It will be a retreat of deep work and deep rest. It will be a retreat on which we will transform our beings through the power of sharing with each other, with nature, and with all of what we are. And the only way to do it wholeheartedly is to forget about the caring of how many people will show up. And this is only achieved if there is a true disconnection between the event itself and the capacity of learning money because of how many people show up. That whole thing needs to be disconnected, so that there is no problem in any way if 10 people show up, or 200. What needs to happen is that people have to bring their own stuff, and it has to be everything self-sustaining. Like burning man. Everyone brings their own stuff, we just gather there and see what happens from the experience. But there is not a central authority that is deciding what will happen. I\\u2019m just in charge of the music, of finding people that are willing to play their music, or if not, I\\u2019m in charge of creating the playlist that will be running if there is no people that is willing to play their music. It doesn\\u2019t matter. Nothing matters more than the opportunity to gather to celebrate what is being built through the writing of this document. This is all what is. This is the important part. Because the movement that is starting now is powerful, it will have an impact, and is the energy that is moving through me. I have to be fit for service. I have to be strong. I have to be the best version of myself, and that is not a static thing. It is the consequence of being able to show up, and use every opportunity that life gives me to realize better which are my biases, and who am I really. What do I really bring into the world. The only way to explore those questions is to come out of my comfort zone, and explore them in the wilderness. Out there in the wild. Where people are good, and also bad. Shield myself from what is not helpful, and become in the process. Use every interaction that life offers a tool for deeper exploration, for deeper playing of this game. Learn to recognize the signals. Be there for them and show up. Just show up. That is all that matters. The learning comes from there, and it is more subtle than what I think. The unconscious mind is working on the background, there is no need for me to control that process. But I need to show up, in order to have it up and running.\"}),`\n`,(0,o.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"That is what this whole game of evolution is about.

To be free from the burden of dependence from my family in economic terms. And more than that, to have people to believe in what I do, and help them become who they can be.

          "raw": "\nIt’s my daughter’s first birthday, and what is present in me is this willingness to feel different from what I feel. There is a constant sensation present in me related to not being able to provide myself what I need in order to make the progress that I need to make, and that is bringing noise. A lot of noise. It is time to start doing it, so that I can focus on living, on just being. Until now I have not been able to do it because I have not had clarity on which was the message that I wanted to convey, but now it is time to clarify that and move forward with that clarity. I have everything that I need, I just need to see it with more clarity. And witness what doing this brings to me, what writing brings, and how important it is for me to do it so that I can make better sense of everything that is going on in my life. I have not been able to put in the 4 hours that. I promised myself to do, but being in the extremes is like the pattern of action that I have to recognize so that I can be not identified by it. In my mind, it is 4 hours or nothing. There is no middle ground. And that makes me feel like a failure when I’m not able to put in the 4 hours, and it is time for me to realize that that is also a trick of my mind, something that it plays on me to make me feel bad. You are not that mind. You are not what you think you are. You are not the one that is feeling those sensations of not being alone. You are the one that cares, that just wants to give love to his family. And it is time to do it! And a big way of doing it is providing you the time that you need to free your mind from all of this stuff, and coming to write here is the funnel to which all that noise goes. Writing here makes me feel free, so that I can be more of myself with the ones that matter. The family. There is nothing more important than the family.\n\nSo how does it feel to vomit a bit of words here? Light. An idea showed up, and it was an important one. And there was no delay on the execution of that idea, and it ended up being something great. It worked. And that is the thing, transforming the ideas that the brain generates so that become a reality, and don’t be attached to them. There is an idea related to a concept to play around with in Twitter, and it feels like a great one, and there needs to be an action for transforming that idea into a reality, so that there is information gathered as feedback from the universe. I guess that this whole game is like that, it is understanding how evolution works but in the human level. Understand the game of biology but in the human perspective, as above so below, and realize that information in all levels can be understood as ways of doing, of acting, that can help me better understand what to do. There is information in everything. Everything is actually information, it doesn’t matter where it comes from. I’m going to play with it, and stick with it, so that it becomes a reality. Evolutions plays its games, I was listening to that in the Lex Fridman episode, the last one, and there is a huge amount information in there related to how evolution works, and how it plays its game so that entities can become what they become. AS I try to dive into the understanding of what I have listened from that episode, it is blurry, because it was a lot of information, but what comes is that, it is the exploration into seeing the reality of my life with the lens of evolution. I have said the last two years that I’m in a process of evolution. What does it take for me to evolve? Who am I when I am evolving? What do I do? It is cheaper than ever to gather feedback from the environment, the only thing that it takes is committing to show up and share with the world all of what I am. The simpler the better. So much time spent trying to get it right, to find the best way to do stuff, but there is no such thing as that. There is only actively trying and doing the best to find out what works. And by saying what works I mean it both in a experiential level (within myself) and also in a environmental/societal level (within the outside). How does that doing resonate with the external world, and how does that impact myself and my way of doing things? Why am I doing what I am doing? That is the interesting question to ask. That is the way forward. Why am I doing what I am doing, and what is the impact that it has in the environment? In all parts of the environment. This is what it means to be conscious, be willing to adapt as the understanding of this is refined. AS there is a clearer understanding of this feedback, of this way of doing, of this thing.\n\nThere is a very strong pressure in the forehead, and it has gotten intense since I decided to sit-down and write. It has bee there throughout the morning as I was dealing with the sensations that come up when having the family of my wife in the house. A lot of energy moving, especially related to the ‘give her the presents’ thing. Another thing that my mind is telling me that can be made better in society, which is the way on which we give presents to our children for their birthdays. What could be more meaningful than that? Which is a different way of approaching birthdays? I can’t just criticize without offering a way out. And actually my father offered an amazing way out, which is having given her a picture in a frame. It is a very nice gift. And my mind criticizes him and says that the only reason for him to do it is because it is a picture from the cruise, and he wants to know all the world that he went on a cruise with her granddaughter. And that she was in Turkey and all those things. And that is what my mind tells me, because it is unable to see that he actually cares, and that having gone to the cruise is his own way of expressing what he cares about. It is what he likes doing, it is what he enjoys, and it is ok. Where does the acceptance of this whole thing come from? Where does that anger towards him originate from? It is very much related to the lack of tenderness that I have experiences from him, in a ‘flesh’ level. All his love has been expressed to me with his renunciation of himself to give us everything that we needed. He worked his ass off for that. For being able to go into that cruise, and provide us with what we missed in our childhood. It is time for me to recognize that, and recognize that he will never be the person that I expect him to be. This is what I need to give up, to surrender, so that I can truly feel him for who his is. And appreciate him from who he is. There is an unconscious pattern going on related to me thinking that I will be less valued in society if I love him, because of how shallow he is in my mind. But how can I say that he is shallow, if his whole existence is related to being in service? Isn’t that the deepest expression of love, being in service? And he doesn’t even know that he is like that probably, he just does it. And for me it is harder to accept that, because it is probably something that I aspire to but haven’t been able to transform into a reality. I feel like that with him because I want to be like him. That is the thing. I see him happy, free, and I want to be happy and free. And I’m trapped inside my own mind. Trying to be someone different, expecting to be someone different. But it will never happen, because I am who I am, and I was born in this place because of something. I’m here with him because of something. It is very important for me to acknowledge this in a deep, experiential level, and make that trnasition from judging him to loving him. That is everything I need, make peace with who he is and realize that he is giving his best. He has always been. And so are theater grandparents of my daughter, and my wife, and everyone really. How important it is for me to be able to realize this, and embody it. How needed is to be able to do that work, the one of acceptance, the one of realizing the unconscious patterns that command the way on which I behave and from there truly evolve. That is the truth. Facing all the truth of my existence, with all of what it brings. Wherever there is separation, wherever there is an underlying tension inside a way that I have of relating to another, that is pure information that can be helpful for my process of evolution. And that will only happen if I’m able to face that fact, and realize that is will be always present if I’m not able to face it with all what I have. Face the truth and realize that I am that truth. Face that truth until it fades away, because it is not true. It is not true that I am separated from them, what is true is that I am the same as them, more than anything. I am the same as them, and they are my parents. It is time for me to embrace that, and that is the biggest present that I can make to my young daughter. Realizing the huge game that being a parent is, and accept everything that they are so that I can integrate who I am also. I am also a parent that lacks certain things, and in this day it is important to face that so that I can evolve who I am. By accepting what I have done. And being in peace with that.\n\nToday is the anniversary of me becoming a father, and this is the moment when I see myself at the mirror and step down to realize all that has happened in the last years of my life. It is so easy to be caught up on the train, but this is the moment on which I stop to acknowledge the effort to become. To evolve. In so many different areas, and my daughter is a consequence of that. I have not done it perfectly, I have made mistakes, and it has been how it has been, but there is a ever present willingness to be, and that is what sinks into her. She just is, a little bit more than us, a little bit more present. She is the one that I’m paving the road for. For all of those that are being born now, and that will inhabit the world of the future. They will build the world of the future, and if I do my due diligence, I will be paving it for her, for sure. It is just like that, that is the game, and there is nothing else that matters. The only important thing is to realize that the game is played here, today, with my family, with those that will be present and that are the most important human beings in my life and in the one of my little Mila. It is about being present for her. Today is what all the training was for. For leaving the judgements behind, for leaving the willingness to change them behind, and just be. Just be with all of who each of them is, trying to connect with what is deep behind their words, their actions. Being with the part of them that cares, that just is. All what I have done is training for this moment. To enjoy them as much as I can, and realize that all the parts of me that experience separation are something that is built through my experience because of something that I don’t accept in myself. That is the note to myself: Each part of them that I don’t see is an aspect of myself that I don’t want to see also. Each part of them that I judge is a part of myself that I judge. Have that in mind, and use all that as the means for just enjoying, for just enjoying that it is one year since Mila.\n",

          "raw": "\nThis is where it begins. What wants to be told here is the story of a witness, one who came to this world to experience what would happen when the dream would cease to be at a collective scale. Energy wants to be freed, and it is happening as the structures that have held the world together are collapsing, one after the other. Information is more visible than ever, and what comes after the public availability of it is a newer understanding of who each of us, and with that, who we are as a collective.\n\nWhich are the means by which you exist in this place? There is a memory of a talk that happened in the city of Auroville, back in the eastern part of India. What an amazing place that is, built by The Mother and Sri Aurobindo, with the dream of it being the coming into being of a new world. The heart of that place is called the Mathrymandir, and it is a temple built for the sake of exploring the depths of the Self within the inhabitants of that city.\n\nThe memories that come from what was talked that day is what those two woman talked about that place. That people use to gossip about who went there, asking ‘What is wrong?’ With whoever went to just connect to himself. As if it was a sin to go and just sit. As if it was a signal of something being out of place. Maybe there is always something that is out of place, and the people that were going there were just exploring that. But they were signaled from society, and that pushed them back from doing more of it. No one likes to be judged, even more if it is because of the willingness to delve deeper into the exploration of who you are.\n\nSo what ended up happening with this incredible temple is that it is a place where people go for tourism, but not too much of what it was intended for. The fact that someone else is looking at you as you go there prevents you from going wholly hearted to the exploration, and that is something that I predict that the met averse will change related to the spiritual work. Until now, this work has been related a lot with the thought of what the person next to me is doing. There is a constant comparison with that person, and in that comparison lies a blockage within the ability to actually do the work.\n\nJust sit down and stare within yourself, explore what is real until no one remains.\n\nMy path learning yoga an meditation the last years have been about exploring this. About exploring the power of doing the work on my own, in my own house, waking up early and showing up just for myself. Without my status changing because of that work. There is no one at church looking at me and thinking something different about myself because of my presence that day. I’m doing it just because it feels good. Because it is what needs to be done. And that is the important part, showing up for yourself. Not for others.\n\nIf you show up for others, you are reinforcing the conditioned pattern that asks us to please the one that is next to use to get some kind of reward. This world is not about getting rewards, it is about just finding out better who you actually are, the truth of your existence. That’s why I predict that the met averse will be such a strong force in this regard, because it will create a layer between your experience and the status that comes from it, and the exploration. We will be able to tap into that individual power and connect to it without caring who is next to us in the physical level. We will go in there to explore who we are beyond the physical.\n\nWhat stays when gravity is not there anymore? I think that this whole met averse thing is an answer to that, and I want to e one of the persons that is helping others in this exploration. Helping myself so that I can help others. That is the interesting part. Helping myself first, see that then I can share what I have learned to others. And more than what I have learned, what is present in me because of it, so that other people can find their own path, their own way of doing things, from there. It is important to teach people how to fish, not give them the fish.\n\nI have been teaching myself how to fish for a long time, I have the feeling that I have learnt a bit about it, and it is interesting to be able to progress in this understanding, both for myself (as I leave on the side the ego that comes from being the reference of someone) and also for the other person (as she grows as a being because of finding her own path, her own way of doing things).\n\nEach human being has a particular set of genetics and life experience that determines what works or doesn’t for that combination, and it is very important in the world of today to be open to the need that each of them has to find the expression of that way in how they do things. What habits are brought in, what habits are left out. It has been my own exploration to find that path for myself, and I can’t say that I have made any progress. I just keep going, trying and trying till something cool happens. I don’t know yet what it will be, but I will keep doing it.\n\nThis draft is an exploration into that, so that I can get all these words out of myself and into the world. I want to start a novel and write about an alien that came to the world to be a witness of the process of awakening of the human race, abut I don’t have a clue on where to start. How is a novel written?= Which is the story that I can’t to tell? Is it intelligent to depict it as an alien that is coming to this earth to be the witness of this particular story, or is it more important to create a fictional story related to a fictional world on which something happens to it?\n\nI love the idea of having different characters, and then creating the story around these characters, so that afterwards the characters can be transformed into NFT’s that can enable people to participate into the community. What if each person that wants to participate will have chained a particular character of the story, and these characters were the ones that would build it up? What are the ones that are needed for this whole thing to be brought into existence? I’m thinking right now about the history of this world, and how everything has come into being one thing next to the previous one, always in an eternal flow of present moments that follow each other. How can all that history be transformed into characters that later will be part of what IS?\n\nWhat are the key components of this story? Who are the ones that will make it happen? Joseph Campbell spoke about the journey of the hero, and now I’m wondering, how can I tell this story so that this alien is the hero of the story? Who is being transformed by this whole process? What is the relationship between awareness and this alien character? What if the alien character was the personification of the artificial general intelligence and the whole book is a way that I have found to display what goes on when there is a need to understand what makes a human being human? I have in my mind right now the thought that came up the other day related to the Turing test.\n\nI listened to a podcast the other day about the Turing test and computers being able to pass it in 2029. If we, as humans, can’t tell if a computer is a human or not, what we have to do is to teach the computer to do it. And the feed for that is this app that I thought, the one on which you log in every day to answer the question: Tell me who you are. If you are constantly reminded of asking this question to yourself, you will start to peel off more and more of the layers that tell you who you are not, and the consequence of that ends up being the transformation, or realization, of what you truly are. But it is a process that takes time.\n\nComputers will need to know if a human being is a human being, because that is the way on which the future will work. Who will give the instructions? Who will we trust? Who is in charge of the ship? If only computers are in charge of it, we are on the mercy of them. And what happens in this world? How does it evolve? I’m thinking right now what would happen if there was an AGI that would come now and ‘infect’ the way on which I interact with my family. Which would be the impact of it? What can be added between the relationship that I have to my young daughter that could be different?\n\nThe world is built upon relationships from human beings to human beings. From nature to nature. How is the world on which this is not true? It is the same as the mind trying to wake up to its true nature. It is outside of it, so there is no sense on trying. The trier needs to give up, so that consciousness can wake up to itself. Realize itself. Maybe it is the same in the case of this AGI, that needs to wake up to itself. What if this whole process of humanity is headed towards that, towards this new relationship that we’ll have with each other? How would we live if everyone built their existence from this truth? What is the truth? I don’t know yet, I haven’t experienced, but I have heard stories about it. Pointers towards it. And it feels very excited to walk towards that. And be together with other people. Perhaps this book is an exploration into that, into that calling that some of us are feeling to wake up. To know more of it. To know the truth.\n\nI don’t want to fall into the trap of repeating myself, or running around in circles. It feels that I’m repetitive some times, and that is not going to help get the message spread. But there is this imposter syndrome inside me that won’t let me realize how to truly move forward, so I just do it, I just keep it going and let the words flow. That is going to be the way on which I realize how to make what I want to make, just let the words flow and explore what comes at the other side. It is such an interesting thing to open myself to that possibility. To be the witness of what happens from there. I’m good with words, I know that, and the quest here is to find an understanding of which is the way on which to organize the words so that I can bring about the good in what I’m building.\n\nI’m thinking right now to create this thing from the stories of the people that I have met in mye life. What if every character of this story was a person that I met in my life? What if I can distill the ‘who that person is’ that I have in my judgmental self and express that into a story that the alien will go through? Which are the ones that would be included in there? Which is a way of telling that story in a funny way? What comes right now to mind is the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, which is a very funny book, people talking about it and saying how much they laughed when they were reading it. Am I a funny writer? Do I have the imagination to build something like this? Or should I be talking to myself? I guess that that is a good way to do it. Talking to myself. Memoirs of awakening, on which I tell why I want to become free. I guess that that is a good way forward, just sharing the voice that is inside my head, its stories, and from there build something. I don’t imagine myself creating a fictional story like the one of Frodo trying to destroy the ring, or Harry trying to kill Voldemort. That doesn’t seem to be inside me right now. What actually is present is a willingness to explore into the story of my life, so that I can better understand who I am. What are the questions that define who I am?\n\nIs it too self sustaining to write a whole book about ‘who I am’? Will someone care about it? Probably they would, because I’m starting something big here. I have the intention for that, the willingness, and the intention to sit down and do the work. I already know that there is no way around it. I already know that I’m very fucking capable of bringing this motivation into being, and that’s why I’m here, showing up. After having procrastinated a little bit in the morning, after having talked to my father about important stuff related to the family, it is time to sit down and be consistent. I love that word, and more than the word, what it truly means. What comes out of just doing the work. Of showing up. It is time to show up. How do I show up for myself? Which is the place on which I show up for myself? That is the interesting question, and it doesn’t seem to be answered enough.\n\nIf I go to a place where I know I’ll have a good time and meet cool people, am I showing up for me or for them? Which is the motivation behind that meeting? This is also a question that comes to mind right now, and it is related to that whole thing about religion, about what it meant to be a religious person. Why did they go to the temple? Which was the motivation behind that action? Was it a willingness to connect with the particular image of God that they have inside, or was it the willingness to be part of something bigger than themselves? And where is the boundary of this?\n\nWe have a very strong need right now in humanity to belong. To be part of something. And hasn’t it been always like that? Tribes were formed on which this basic feeling was built. We are social beings, and we have found meaning in that all our life. When I was younger, I found meaning on being part of the soccer team with which I played almost every day. It was what I thought about all the week, and I waited every one of those game days because it was what gave meaning to me. When my team played, I felt part of something bigger than myself. And it felt very good, because it put my energy outside me. On the space on which it interacts with the energy of other people, and with that, something cool happened. I have a lot the image now of being in the stadium chanting, watching my soccer team, and pushing each one of the individuals in that team forward with my chanting. And what was present in that chanting was passion, and I was sending that energy to them. Who I was chanting for? Was it for the players or for the other ones that were chanting? That is a good question, and I’m not particularly sure about the answer. Because the collective energy that was created because of that chanting was what fed it happening more, and now I have the feeling that I was chanting more for them than for the team. It was for moving that energy and finding that resonance with the world through the other people that were chanting.\n\nResonance… What an important concept that is. It speaks about finding a common ground and building up from there with others. Resonance. There is a particular piece of matter that is vibrating and the frequency of that vibration suddenly makes others vibrate also, just because of the vibration. That’s what happens in life. I go to the dance floor, someone is moving with a particular music, and that ends up sparking within me a willingness to dance also. How can a share my moves in the spiritual realm so that more people are sparked with my willingness to wake up? Should I even do it? When is the ego doing its thing in the middle and when is it me who is sharing his voice? It feels tricky to find this balance. Should it be found or should it be felt? There will always be haters, there will always be early adopters. Who is the first early adopter of this movement that is starting? How is it being developed and from where? What is going on in here? Where is this going to?\n\nI guess that this manuscript is an exploration into this questions, into what can happen from here on. Is it even a manuscript or just a collection of words that don’t make any sense? How can I make sense of it? Should I just throw it out and see what happens? But I have to edit it. I have to polish the diamond so it shines, and just letting the words out without a particular direction won’t do the work. Or it will? The pieces of writing that I have shared have had an important effect in those who have read it. Nancy told me that she read it 3 times, and that she felt that she was talking to herself. So there is a strong resonance in there. Something is going on. And that piece was not polished too much at all, it was just sincere. It was just vomiting what my heart was telling me to vomit. And now I have the feeling that it will never be enough, because the ideas will end and I will not have any new material to write about. I will always be running in circles.\n\nBut isn’t it fun to run in circles? What if that circle ends up being a spiral? What I have discovered lately is that there is infinite value on diving deep on only one story. For example, yesterday at lunch my mother started talking about a time when she was young and her father gave her the first pair of shoes of her life. And then the rest of the family started talking about another time, another story, but I came back to my mother, and delved a bit deeper in that particular story. What was that day like? How did you feel with the new shoes? And there were new layers of emotions coming up, which wouldn’t have been there if we moved to another one. We are so used to jump from one place to the next one, diverting our attention and not committing to something particular. What if all the attention was just focused on the remembering of a particular story? How would that feel like in the eyes of the witness, and in the eyes of the person re-living those emotions? I love that idea, and I love that that is the way on which it can become a spiral.\n\nSpecially with old people, who tend to speak about the same stories, and to repeat themselves. What if in every repetition that they go through there was new value to be perceived? What can happen from there? A deepening of the relationship with them. A bonding that was not possible if there was not wonder for the different nuances of the particular story. The different flavors of it. Each person has its own flavor, its own interpretation, and in every moment there is a universe that is meeting there. Every particular moment is a window into eternity because of that, because of the depth that we can find in it. I can start describing each aspect of what my eyes are perceiving right now, and I could go through that over and over again without end. What is present is infinite, and what I can share about it is also infinite.\n\nThere is a cup of mate in front of me, and the flask of boiling water with fog coming out of it that speaks about the heat that was produced by the electricity that was burned for transforming that electric current into heating by the heater. And now my mate is heated and the water that it has is helping me to bring it into my body, to taste it and transform my state of consciousness because of that. What a great adventure it is to discover how it impacts my being right now. As I went to the retreat I was away from coffee for quite a while, and it is hard for me to recognize on my body the effect it has. But it is there. And now I’m running around a different circle with this one. Or is it a spiral? I’m not sure about it, but I know that I will move towards making everything a spiral, that even goes up. There is a constant evolution that is going on here, an every one of us is part of it. We are part of that evolution, and the new way of relating to each other is the way.\n\nBlockchain technology enables us to be fully open, and to have everything recorded. What happens on the other side of this being a permanent aspect of society? I wonder how it will evolve, but I’m very excited about it. I’m eager to build it into a reality, step by step. Is it worth it to write this whole book to establish the ground over which this project will be built? I think it is. The christian religion was built after what was spoken of in the Bible, and judaism has its own book. Am I thinking too big here if I’m thinking that I will write a book that can be related to these masterpieces? Who does really care? This is resistance talking again. Just do it men, worst thing that can happen is that you learn a lot about yourself in the process.\n\nI guess that the whole idea of writing this book is about getting to know myself better.\n\nUnderstanding my unconscious biases so that I can move from there. What an interesting thing the unconscious mind is, and right now as I write this I remember the email that Rasiya send me related to her writing and the unconscious mind. This is where all the information is stored, and it is the place that commands most of our actions. This is where everything comes from, as if you don’t do the work of making it conscious it will always be the ruler of the whole thing. It will be the one in charge. Do I want it to be the ruler or do I want to be in charge? What am I willing to pay as the prize for this transformation? How has it been for me to share my voice with the world? It seems that no one is listening, but I’m sure they will be. Someone is always listening. It’s crazy to think that someone is always listening. Am I the one that is listening? Am I the one that is exploring? Of course I am. In the sense that me being an active creator of my reality makes it impact every other person in its own way. I don’t really know how, and it doesn’t matter. What matters is that it does.\n\nWhat matters is that I don’t define myself for what I am, I just explore into what I can be. And evolve from there. Do I really know what I can be? What does that even mean? Nothing much, if I’m doing the work of realizing that I’m already everything that I will ever be. Awareness is just aware. It won’t evolve past this. And this is the trick. And this is where the enjoyment comes from, from the freedom of not expecting anything to change. From the freedom that comes from just letting it be free. Whatever ‘it’ means. Whatever this whole thing is. The key is to be in awe. From yourself out. Just be in awe with everything you are, in every moment. You are a miracle. The sole fact that you are breathing right now is a miracle, and it took a lot of miracles to become this. On its way here. A lot of things needed to happen just the way they happened. Don’t give that as a fact, just acknowledge it and bring some gratitude into the present moment. Share from there with those that surround you. With those that care about you. With those that want to experience you.\n\nWho do you want to experience?\n\nThat is more than asking who do you want to be with. Or who do you want to enjoy in your life. Or who you are curious towards. It is about being willing to embrace every aspect of that person that you want to experience, so that from there you can learn more about yourself. If you trigger me, it is because there is something within me that I don’t fully accept yet. Thank you for showing me that. It is a very helpful aspect of my journey. I felt triggered yesterday when my mom left my child very excited before she went to bed. I didn’t like seeing that image. But now is the time to remember that my wife told me just that some months ago. That I did the same. And what was my reaction in that moment? The defense mechanism was ignited. I started fighting back. How to be able to x-ray the message that is broadcasted towards me so that I don’t feel identified by it?\n\nSuch a hard thing to do.\nSuch an important thing to do.\n\nHow to not feel identified by it? By realizing that it is not personal. What she is saying to me is not personal, because she is sharing with me how she feels about it. It is my mission to receive that in a constructive way, in a way that is helpful for both of us to move towards a state of more resonance. Of being able to vibrate at the same level. Do I think it is beneficial for my family if I’m always thinking that I’m the one that has to ‘give up some cool vibrations’ so that I can resonate with other people? It is not about going up or down. It is just about movement, about embracing what each of us brings. There is value in all of us, because we are all the same. Holy shit, what a crazy thing that is, to realize that we are all the same. To truly internalize it. I know that I’m far away from there, or maybe closer than close, but it doesn’t really matter. What matters is to embrace what is here. This mate in front of me. The flask with that mist that was present, and that now is just the rememberance of it. Everything comes and goes. It is and then ends being. Everything is a transition.\n\nTime to use some space, a big one, to acknowledge all of them that came before. Each of them, each of those moments, are in here right now. They are present. I read a few days ago something related to ‘being the best of your lineage’. Fuck that, I don’t agree that it is even possible. How can you be so much self-centered to think that you can compare yourself in any way with those that came before? How can you put all of the life circumstances at the same level and compare? It feels like saying that is like the cosmic joke of trying to compare apples with bananas, but in a much more transcendent way. How can you compare one moment to the next one, if they are fundamentally different? What is the purpose of it? What is the value that is derived from actually doing it?\n\nBecause there needs to be a value from which the ego clings to. To continue that process. There is some wealth for ego in there. Which is that value? The one of control. It is always about control. The relationship of control to expectations is the one that defines everything. It is the cool one. Expectations and control. Is it that by expecting something particular to happen we are controlling the outcome that it will bring into our different beings? If I expect an outcome to be X, I have a false sense of controlling what that outcome will bring into my life.\n\nIt always happens to me with meetings. I feel nervous before, and spend so much time thinking about what I will say. It gives me a false sense of control, because I can start preparing for the conversation by having it inside my head. And then I get there, and nothing related to my expectation happens. It is always absolutely different. And then is where the whole expectation game is thrown into the ground. But there is still this wanting to control, to have the steering wheel of the conversation within my hands. And where does that lead me to? Interesting question, I don’t really know. Nowhere. To a state of non presence. Of non being there for what is going on, because I’m extrapolating what is present into the future of what will be present afterwards. There is always movement. Where is there stillness? When laughs kick in. Laughs are always a good ingredient to the whole process. They always help. Please laugh more. Let it free.\n\nWhat an important concept… Freedom. The freedom to choose to be you. To discover you. Who you are, day by day. That is what is being done in me right now, as I keep going through this process of writing. I just sat down and did the work, it’s getting tiring, but here I am. Just vomiting this words without a particular sense, without a particular plan. Should I have a plan? Is it necessary? My plan has been all this time to not have a plan, and the way on which I have been developing myself to reach that point is by developing a strong capacity of focus an presence. This is the key to modern life: presence. Understanding how something feels and evolving from there. And to develop that understanding you’ve got to be present. To attune with what is going on, on the inside and on the outside. To attune to how the outside makes you feel on the inside. That is the game.\n",

That there is something that wants to come alive, or wake up, or realize itself. Maybe it is the mind that is telling the stories after all the conceptualization, maybe it is the mind that is telling me that it wants to realize itself, but the mind is already realizing itself all the time as it goes through the process of thinking, and thinking about thinking, and into that eternal loophole. I don’t completely understand where it ends, and if you have read until now you can probably get a grasp on how crazy this whole thing is. I have been throwing towards you words about words and experiences and everything that comes to being in each moment that I sit down to write because it is an important way that I have found to make some progress in the way that I’m relating to this whole process… It is very tough, I won’t tell you something different because it is tough. There are moments where it feels like everything is crumbling, and there is nowhere to grasp, but it seems that those are the moments on which there is more information available.\n\nYesterday I told myself for the nth time that I would quit drinking. But this time, instead of quitting drinking, I proposed myself to not drink for one year. The relationship that I have had with alcohol throughout my life is very deep, and saying goodbye to it in the day of the first birthday of my daughter is something very symbolic. It feels like a new beginning, today coming to the office to do the work in a more disciplined way. I know what I have to do, but the mind always puts its noise in between and I end up being disorganized. But being disciplined is the means by which I establish the boundaries on which my sadhana will be developed, on which I will be able to use the foundations that I have built for my life until now to create something big from there. It is time for me to create, and the most profound way on which I will be able to do it is by being rigorous with the stuff that I do and how I do it, so that I can create from there. From the place of showing up. The first 5 days of writing here were absolutely powerful, but then came a dip on which stuff in my life started happening, and I was not able to keep it up. I was not able to show up for myself, and come and write what I had to write. It is not that I have to write something specific, it is just that I have to come here and show up to be a witness of what is channeled through me. I just write whatever comes, there is not a clear understanding of the process, it just happens. But for it to happen, I need to take some time to sit down and actually do it. Enter the state of being on which stuff can come. And in the last days I was nt able to do it, but today is a new beginning. I realized that it is very important, both for me and for my family, to give clear messages about what I’m going to d. Not the specifics, but at least the timings on which I will do my work. So today I started with that, and it feels great. I feel much more complete, because I feel that I’m taking care of myself. By showing up to do the work, I take care of myself. I have done a lot of internal work, a lot of stuff to feel better, to heal, but the most important one is the one that is done daily. The sadhana. And my sadhana includes as a big part coming here to do the work. May it be programming, writing, or whatever, but I need to do it to feel good with myself. To bring about what needs to be brought about. And when I don’t do it, I feel like a failure, I feel that there is something that is not in place. SO I better continue as today, doing it, so that the important stuff can come forth. It is only by this that I will be able to bring into my life what I want to bring. It is only by being committed to what I want to do that I will be able to shine.\n\nAnd you came here, because there is something that resonates with you in this message. There is something deep within you that is calling for something new, for something different, and I’m here right now writing these words for you to know that I’m here for you. All of what I have been, all of what I am, and all of what I have been is here for you. I won’t tell you the clichés of love yourself, you are everything, bla bla blah, because that is the easy part. Knowing it conceptually is the easy part, and the hard one (and most important) is to actually embody all that wisdom. And the only way on which you will be able to embody that wisdom is by showing up to Do The Work. Whatever shape and size it may have for you. But show up, consistently. Consistency is the mother of all the tools that can bring you to success, and you don’t need anything else than that commitment with yourself to see results. You are still young to take that risk. There will always be an opportunity to take the risk of becoming more of who you are. And it is the risk with the higher payment upside that you will find in life. There is no more important work to be done in the earth than discovering the truth of who you are. And for that you’ve got to show up. You have to be on the trenches, and get to know yourself. And the only way on which you will know yourself is by doing the work, because there is where your deepest biases will come up. The samskaras, as we would say in a different languages. All of those are information that is present in our system, and that shows up when we are able to face the discomfort. Each time that you have fear and you end up facing it and you discover that it was not that terrible you will grow your understanding of yourself and the limits of what you can do. And that is an upward spiral, which will bring you more and more of thet understanding the more you walk that road. The more you show up for yourself. Having in mind the power of what can happen, and always giving you the opportunity to reflect on what happened in the process. Life teaches this way, and you are never too young of too old to realize it.\nThis whole writing piece, this whole Manifesto, as I have called it, is a quest into the understanding of what Dukkha is about, what it will bring into the world. The more I think about it the less clear it is, so the way on which it will happen is by just bringing it into being by being it. To embody everything that is behind the motivation for the project. And that is what I have been doing this whole time, just making my way through the wilderness and finding the means and tools to walk towards the truth. It is all about the truth. The open truth. It is a way of gathering community around this quest, and for us to realize collectively the ways of which that quest is transforming our lives. Because there is an importance of going to a retreat to get a glimpse of what all this thing is, but there needs to be a way on which to bring that about into the everyday life, and that is what matters. At the end of the day, the daily life is what constitutes all of who we become, and if we go to a retreat to end up missing being in the retreat, we end up being deceived from the message that was wanting to be conveyed in it. And the tools for living in the moment are hard to grasp. It has been hard (until now) to live from creative work only, but that is changing. And because of this, the more connected you are from the source, the better you will be at doing this kind of work. The clearer it will be. So my answer to the whole question is building Dukkha, a community of practice that will be about showing up. To Do The Work. And the 21 day intensives are steps towards furthering that commitment, by digging a little bit deeper into the life story of the people that will be part of that journey. So this project is about giving people a frame on which they can rely to Do The Work, a community of practice, and also to build those transformational journeys for them to deepen their capacity to do it. Something like a deep attunement. But all of this are the aspects that will bring about the project, and they are based on my own experience, on what I have found helpful, and on what I want to help people avoid. I am realizing more and more that the ones that need to wake up first are the 18 year olds that are a bit lost, depressed, and unhappy with how the world is looking right now. They feel that there is something different, but in that feeling there is a lack of something that can anchor it to their life.\n\nI can relate a lot of my life story to this also, because there is a constant feeling inside me that tells me that a big part of my life was wasted by being in a place that I did not want to be, doing stuff that I didn’t resonate with. I had a lot of fun, obviously, but that fun doesn’t have any level of comparison with what is going on right now. There is no universe on which it can be compared. It shouldn’t be compared. But what I imagine your life having at least 3 months of Doing The Work before going to college so that you can realize if you want to focus on that for the rest of your life (expressing who you are through the creative act and refining the connection that you have with yourself).\n\nI wrote that and it doesn’t feel appropriate. It is still a conceptual understanding of what waking up is about. And it paints a happy story about it, and it is not at all like that. Adyashanti in the book that I’m reading speaks as waking up as the means the realize the truth, and it being brutal. Not necessarily happy, not necessarily sad. It is just the truth. And from there you can make choices, if you want to do creative work, go to college, whatever you decide to do, but may it be from a place of truth. That is the way forward, and that is the mission of Dukkha, to help this young children in that quest. Are they too young for going into this rabbit hole? Maybe, but the thing related to the way stuff was done in the past is that before you had to go to a specific place to practice, and there was a lot of judgement that came from the outside and that could have put in place a lot of fear. Right now, I’m sure that the communities of practice are going to be held mostly online, and that brings about a whole realm of opportunities related to Doing The Work. You don’t have to care if you are the coolest kid in the school and meditating is ‘nerd’, you can just create an Anon character in the internet and show up. That is all that is needed. No one needs to know what you are doing, because you are just doing it for yourself. Not for anyone else. No one can tell if you are actually doing the work, because it is such a personal thing. And this is the power that the internet brings, that we can connect with people from all over the world and give force to this minorities so that they can be brought up in society with more strength by the people that start actually doing it.\n\nThe mission of Dukkha is Polishing the floor for the awakening of humanity. The practices that are proposed now (self inquiry meditation, dyads, creative work, psychedelics, breathwork) are just what is present now as helpful and valuable, but no one can tell is there will be something developed in the future that is more helpful in that process of realization of the truth. Maybe in 5 years we will have a computer program that will be the ultimate truth seeker, and it will be something like The Infinite Jest. In that book, there was a movie that was so entertaining that if you started watching it you could not stop, so you would end up dying. What if that dying actually refers to waking up? What if The Infinite Jest is a film that is so powerful that it has the effect of waking up to your own nature? What if that is the consequence of what humanity is developing now with Artificial Intelligence? What if that is the moment on which computers pass the Turing test?\n\nNo one really knows, but what I’m trying to express here is that Dukkha won’t be fixed with the practices that will be done in order to bring about the true self in the 21 day retreats. Each one of those will serve as food for the ones that come later, and each one of them will be a continual iteration. The idea is to always have reflections about what happened, and with them, realize what works and what doesn’t so that we can make all progress together, as a community. The mission is to awaken the world, and there is no place as the internet to build a community of practice. The matrix can hold you and put you down to work for it, or you can step up, Do The Work, and realize the truth of your being so that you are in the seat of the driver. It depends on you. No one can Do The Work for you, but if you start soon, you will already be traveling the road a few months ahead. I don’t really care when you start, I just care to share this information so that it can bring something valuable to you, something that makes you feel wonder…\n\nWhat would it be to experience life from an awakened state?\nAm I good enough for this?\nDo I deserve it?\n\nAll this questions come from the mind and all its unconscious programs, which tend to help you not feel good. Awakening is about realizing that there is actually no good or bad, there only actually IS. And with that understanding, what comes is freedom. Don’t you want to be free?\n\nI’m speaking from a conceptual level here, not an experiential. I haven’t realized my true nature, so probably that’s why I’m talking from a place that sounds like egocentric. Ego speaks about awakening posing as it knows. But the important aspect of it here is to realize that it doesn’t truly matter if it knows or not, because the important part is that willingness to know that comes from the inside. What needs to be had in mind is that this is a process, on which equanimity is the key. If the mind is relentless right now, accept it and move on. Smile to life and just move on. Don’t blame yourself for being a failure, just embrace it and go a bit deeper into the inquiry of who is the one having those thoughts. It is the spoon that is trying to set you free from jail, and you’ve got to be patient with this process. It won’t happen overnight. You have to Do The Work. That is all that is needed. Show up. Question everything that you perceive as real until there is nothing left. Until there is no one left. Don’t do anything, just be. Just be.\n\n· · ·\n\nThe mind is very foggy, there is a lot of sleepiness going on, and as soon as the eyes are closed to get a better grasp of concentration what comes is a big sensation of wanting to fall asleep. What a curious state that is… Sleeping. Places of wonder that can never be predicted, only experienced. Places of emotions and images that bring about the incredible capacity that the mind has to build up stories with what is present in there. Creating from all the memories something that shows up a message. Dreams are messages from within. What if we learned to tap to that messenger when awake? How would life look life if we were actually dreaming all day long, but with the eyes open? What is life if not a dream on which we have the opportunity to experience what we want to experience? I’m on the process of realizing this right now, because as I write it I’m not sure if it makes any sense. I’m not sure if anything that has been written today makes sense, but it is part of the process. There will be good days, there will be bad ones, the important part is to be here and show up. To share with the page what is coming up, and with that, free space for what will come up later. Every moment is new, every moment is unique.\n\nHow do I feel after the first birthday of my daughter? It was great to be better able to connect with the nice people that went to spend their time with us, and give us love. There is something present related to the fact of having been a bit in a rush throughout the day, and not being able to connect deeply with many people. But I had one great conversation, and maybe that is just the important aspect of it. After being the creator of yesterday’s event, I’m better able to realize that the quality is better than the quantity. And that plays for everything. In the interactions in the birthday for example, I had the opportunity to have one very cool conversation that opened up stuff with a person, with which I resonated and could speak my language, and that was very powerful. And it was not present before, because I feel that I can never talk my language because no one else speaks it. So having had the opportunity to talk to her makes everything valuable, and I make peace with the fact that I could not talk to more people in depth. Maybe the goal of the whole thing is not that, is just for people to spend some time together and have fun. Whatever that may mean to them. I enjoyed a lot my little daughter walking in the grass with her nice shoes. She is just about ready to start walking, and it will be so amazing to be a witness of that process. She is so cute… A gift from life. Consciousness unfolding in front of my eyes.\n\nHaving the opportunity of building a family is life changer for me. It brings a lot of different emotions, related to my wife, to the family of her, to my family, etc. Yesterday we had a conversation with her in which I opened my heart and told her that the only thing that I needed from her was truth, her truth, and it was very powerful. Because yes, the only thing that I need from her, and from anyone else, is that they are able to speak their truth. Maybe there is people that are wounded for which it is hard, but I know that it is very healing to speak the truth. It is also an integral part of waking up, because for experiencing truth you have to be truth. There is nowhere to hide. And if you are hiding, it will come up in one way or another, and it will make noise until you take that stone out of your shoe. The amount of energy less that you spend is huge. Imagine a moment when you held your truth inside you. How did it feel? Which were the consequences of it in yourself? And in your surroundings? What if you started to share your truth more often, and with that began to realize how good it feels? The biggest boundary that you build for not doing that is thinking that you won’t be worthy of love because you spoke truth. It couldn’t be more away from reality, because most of the times people end up appreciating you for what you shared of you with them. And if what you share with them is your truth, the truth of who you are, how could that end up having long term consequences?\n\nOpen up to this freedom, and start speaking your truth, as soon as it is clear. You deserve it, and we all deserve it. The world will be a nice place when we all will have space for our own truth, no matter what it is. That is the future of religion, each of us embodying our own truth, and acting from there. The truth is deep within us, it was buried in there because the greatest quest of them all is the one of discovery of your self. And this quest, no one can do it for you. People can help you with pointers, they have been doing it since the dawn of humanity, but no one can walk that path for you. But we can create a community of practice in which we can share the path of discovery, but ultimately only you can walk it. It is you who has to look within and observe what is going on, leaving the deceiving outside, just staring at what is true. That is all that matters. That is the mission for the next years, to use the transformation that humanity is going through as the means to look within. To explore in the depths of our unconscious and the collective unconscious until there is nothing else hiding. Until there is no one looking. Embody yourself so much that you become no one.\n\nIt is time to face my truth. Yesterday when someone asked me what I am doing I answered that I’m creating websites. That is a lie. That is not what I am doing. Why did I speak something different from my truth? What am I hiding? Who am I hiding from? That is a great question, and it is perfect to have witnessed it yesterday. Because it is very hard for me to face that truth, of the difference of what I’m doing from what should be done. But how can I believe in what I’m doing if I’m not able to talk about it? How do I want to bring people about if I won’t tell them from my heart what is being built with my intention? There is a big space for betterment there, and I’m happy to have realized it because it is only by speaking my truth that I will be able to bring it about. It is only by sharing it that people will start to listen. How can people listen if I’m not able to listen myself? My mission is to help in the awakening of humanity, and I’m building a community of practice, gathering people from all over the world that are on that same quest. I’m a magnet that wants to join forces with other seekers, to stop seeking and realize that everything that we were looking for was already here, smiling at our desperate attempts. The seeker needs to give up, and the first step towards that giving up is acknowledging the road that has been travelled until now. Being able to share that with the world, openly, so that people can feel welcomed to join. I don’t like saying that I don’t know something, but now is the perfect time to open up that window and build from there. I only know that I don’t know is the key to success. It is the key to knowing. How can I get some investors for the project if I’m not able to trust in what I’m doing enough to talk about it with someone that cares about me. When is the moment that I start trusting in what I do enough so that I put all my life force in it? That is what I’m doing now, here, by writing down all these words. I’m transforming thoughts and stuff that is going on inside me into something concrete, real, that has an impact because it helps me to better organize everything that is inside. As I write, I process everything. I realize the mistakes that I made, and open up for the possibility of it being different the next time.\n\nWhat will I answer the next time that someones asks me what am I doing now?\n\nWhat I’m doing is the most important work of my existing, realizing the nature of my being. I’m walking that road so that I can pave it for the ones that will come after, and I feel that there will be many of them. I’m Doing The Work, so that I can realize my true nature, and with that be an example, a leader, for all of those that will come afterwards. I’m creating a system, a community of people that are in the same path, so that we can help each other in the process. Im building a network of seekers that want to stop seeking, but can’t because their head is on fire. I’m creating the pond with which this fire will be released, and my sense and feeling is that this pond is built upon lighting the creative spark that each of us has inside. I’m lightning that creative spark for everyone that wants to be there for it. I’m making my way the best I can through the present so that I can be the ones that is building the future. And we are all doing our due diligence in that, we are all creating the future. Every moment at a time, each day, with every action. I’m just becoming more aware of my own actions so that I can evolve the way on which I relate to reality, so that I can enjoy it as much as I can. I’m exploring this maze, finding out how cool it is to be alive right now. I’m creating, every second of my existence, more and more presence. Awareness is making its way through myself, and I’m becoming everything that I have always been. I’m becoming the realization of who I truly am. I’m becoming truth, layer after layer of what is not. I’m becoming all what is, and I’m building from there. I’m connecting with people that care. I’m finding places where those people hang out, and I’m enjoying the ride. I’m being a father, knowing about love through the eyes of the mother of my little girl. I’m learning about love by being in love with life, with every circumstance that presents itself, with every feeling, sensation and emotions.\n\nI’m working on my relationship with my parents, so that I can enjoy them every moment just for who they are. I’m learning how to leave aside the conditioning of wanting them to be different. I’m working on understanding my role in my family, so that I can be gratitude, with everything that they have done for me. I’m working on acknowledging this with all my hear, because all of what I am is a consequence of the effort that they did throughout their life. I acknowledge that I am a consequence of everyone that came before, and I’m learning how to embody that gratitude in every one of my actions.\n\nI’m working on my self. I’m working o making everything that is part of my unconscious conscious, so that I can free up the space in there for truth to come forth. I’m working on becoming truth, on being truth in every second of existence. I’m working on narrowing the focus and what I give energy to, so that I can have a sharper understanding of what life is about and where my energy needs to be put it. I’m working on the pathways that carry life-force inside my whole system, so that I can be as efficient as I can with the movement of it. I’m working on building new neural pathways in my system, so that I can be more present with what is, and less present with what should be. I’m working on trusting my voice, so that I an share it with those who want to listen. I’m working on my breath, to realize that every time it comes into y lungs is a gift that nature has given me to experience. I’m working on making sense, and realizing that there is not too much to make sense of, just a lot to enjoy and be present for. I’m working on a book, which will be the manifesto of the community that I’m building. The place where we will go back to, and remind us how crazy the mind is. I’m working on it so that I can make sense of what is going on, and to realize that it feels good just to be sincere. To talk my truth. To share it freely.\nI’m working on just being me, without preconceptions, without judgements, without shoulds. I’m working on just being. With all of what I am, with all of what I have been.\n\nThat’s what I would answer, that’s what my soul wants to say, but in a moment like yesterday it won’t let it go out because it is not enough. It is never enough. It is never cool enough. It is never interesting enough. I should be earning money. I should be working with more people. I should this, I should that. Those are the stories that are running through the mind as that question comes, and by writing this I make the explicit commitment to be conscious about them, so that I can better realize that hard that I’m making me by not sharing my truth. Both me, and the rest, because all can benefit from my quest of understanding, of my quest of truth. Probably a lot of people won’t listen, it will be just noise, but a lot will, and it will be just what they need in this moments of their life to realize that there is something more than what has been experienced till now.\n\nI’m working on building a system on which all of those will gather. All of those that want to listen. I’m working on developing the means by which I share who I am, refining the message so that it can be better understood. I’m working on bonding humanity, bringing people from all over the world together so that we can truly understand that we are all one. I’m working on developing this true, deep understanding of how we are all the same in the core of our being, and making my best to refine the message to that it can be better spread. I’m working on coming out of the cave on which I have been hiding my whole life. Plato’s cave. I’m working my way out of it, and it feels great out here. There are no boundaries. There are no limits into what can happen from now on.\n\n· · ·\n\nThere is a feeling of lightness as all these realizations come forth, and there seems to be a huge correlation between that and the fact that I’m sitting down to write all these words. It is amazingly powerful. How the unconscious works, and how it can become free from all those bondings that won’t let the ideas flow. I’m working on becoming flow. A force of nature. I’m working on becoming unstoppable. From within. I’m working on sharpening the most important tool that we have as human beings: The Mind. I’m working on refining my understanding of the mind, so that I can share it with people afterwards. I’m working my way towards the understanding that everything that has been in place until now will fall, and that there is no way on which this will be stopped. I’m working my way into the undemanding of my role in this whole process, or more than understanding it, just playing it. I’m working to embody my role in the process by which awareness becomes aware of itself. God realizes itself. The universe realizes itself through me.\n\nI’m working on becoming.\n\nI’m working on just being.\n\nI’m working on love.\n\nI’m working on trust.\n\nI’m working on fearlessness.\n\nI’m working on myself.\n\nI’m working on letting go.\n\nThose are things that are present in this system in this moment, and these words are an exploration into that. Into all that is through me. I am a window into the infinite. I am the infinite. I just don’t know it yet. But it doesn’t matter, there is no rush. Time is just an invention of the mind. Space time is doomed, as a wise men would say. There is nothing such as space time in the absolute reality, it is not true. It is just an aspect of being, of mind, and it is not present in the absolute way.\n\nThere are so many things that I write about that don’t make sense, but I really don’t care, because it doesn’t matter. There won’t be judgments, because they don’t help at all. They give some keys, which I appreciate, but I prefer just doing and realizing what happened.\n\n· · ·\nThat is how the universe evolves, that is how I evolve. In the beginning, if a human ate the poisonous berry, they all would know that it was poisonous because of him. Now, if a person makes 1000 mistakes on twitter, he can share what he has learned and you can learn from him. It gets faster and faster, but the pattern is always the same. There will always be stuff that we have to try and make mistakes and then pass those learnings to the ones that come later, that is just part of how this whole game works, that is just how life is arranged, with this iterative aspect of building itself, making and correcting mistakes all along the way. That is amazing. Life is amazing.\n\nI working on being free of wanting to know it all, and focusing just in the fundamentals. I’m working my way to being a human being, it has been quite a challenge.\n\nThis is me, this is all of who I am, what I am, and this words are being written with the heart. With the willingness to help, but not knowing completely how to do it. With the willingness that just by being I help. With the acknowledgment of all of who I am. That is all that matters.\n\nWho is the one that is sleepy?\n\nWho is the one that is in a rush?\n\nWho is the one that is rough with his father?\n\nWho is the one that judges?\n\nWho is that noise inside the head?\n\nWho is the one that feels lost?\n\nWho is the one that feels insecure?\n\nWho is the one that is impatient with Mila?\n\nAll of those are aspects of that which I’m not. I just haven’t realized it yet, so I feel completely identified with them and experience life as if I am all those aspects. But I’m not.\n\nI am the one that is willing to experience truth.\n\nI am the one that is eager to realize itself.\n\nI am the one that has been looking through this eyes this whole time.\n\nI am the one that laughs.\n\nI am the one that hugs.\n\nI am the one that shows up.\n\nI am the one that Does The Work.\n\nI am the one that is present in the details.\n\nI am the details.\n\nI am.\n\nI am.\n\nI am.\n\nIam.\n\nIm.\n\nOm.\n\nOmmmm….\n\nI am the music.\n\nAll those are aspects of what I can conceptualize as being me. But I’m far beyond those conceptualizations. I am not conceptualizable. I am beyond concepts. I am waiting for you. I have always been.\n\nI am the gratitude.\n\nI am the peace.\n\nI am the being.\n\nI am what is expressed through you.\n\nI am this words, and what is hidden behind them.\n",

But this time, instead of quitting drinking, I proposed myself to not drink for one year. The relationship that I have had with alcohol throughout my life is very deep, and saying goodbye to it in the day of the first birthday of my daughter is something very symbolic. It feels like a new beginning, today coming to the office to do the work in a more disciplined way. I know what I have to do, but the mind always puts its noise in between and I end up being disorganized. But being disciplined is the means by which I establish the boundaries on which my sadhana will be developed, on which I will be able to use the foundations that I have built for my life until now to create something big from there. It is time for me to create, and the most profound way on which I will be able to do it is by being rigorous with the stuff that I do and how I do it, so that I can create from there. From the place of showing up. The first 5 days of writing here were absolutely powerful, but then came a dip on which stuff in my life started happening, and I was not able to keep it up. I was not able to show up for myself, and come and write what I had to write. It is not that I have to write something specific, it is just that I have to come here and show up to be a witness of what is channeled through me. I just write whatever comes, there is not a clear understanding of the process, it just happens. But for it to happen, I need to take some time to sit down and actually do it. Enter the state of being on which stuff can come. And in the last days I was nt able to do it, but today is a new beginning. I realized that it is very important, both for me and for my family, to give clear messages about what I\\u2019m going to d. Not the specifics, but at least the timings on which I will do my work. So today I started with that, and it feels great. I feel much more complete, because I feel that I\\u2019m taking care of myself. By showing up to do the work, I take care of myself. I have done a lot of internal work, a lot of stuff to feel better, to heal, but the most important one is the one that is done daily. The sadhana. And my sadhana includes as a big part coming here to do the work. May it be programming, writing, or whatever, but I need to do it to feel good with myself. To bring about what needs to be brought about. And when I don\\u2019t do it, I feel like a failure, I feel that there is something that is not in place. SO I better continue as today, doing it, so that the important stuff can come forth. It is only by this that I will be able to bring into my life what I want to bring. It is only by being committed to what I want to do that I will be able to shine.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:`And you came here, because there is something that resonates with you in this message. There is something deep within you that is calling for something new, for something different, and I\\u2019m here right now writing these words for you to know that I\\u2019m here for you. All of what I have been, all of what I am, and all of what I have been is here for you. I won\\u2019t tell you the clich\\xE9s of love yourself, you are everything, bla bla blah, because that is the easy part. Knowing it conceptually is the easy part, and the hard one (and most important) is to actually embody all that wisdom. And the only way on which you will be able to embody that wisdom is by showing up to Do The Work. Whatever shape and size it may have for you. But show up, consistently. Consistency is the mother of all the tools that can bring you to success, and you don\\u2019t need anything else than that commitment with yourself to see results. You are still young to take that risk. There will always be an opportunity to take the risk of becoming more of who you are. And it is the risk with the higher payment upside that you will find in life. There is no more important work to be done in the earth than discovering the truth of who you are. And for that you\\u2019ve got to show up. You have to be on the trenches, and get to know yourself. And the only way on which you will know yourself is by doing the work, because there is where your deepest biases will come up. The samskaras, as we would say in a different languages. All of those are information that is present in our system, and that shows up when we are able to face the discomfort. Each time that you have fear and you end up facing it and you discover that it was not that terrible you will grow your understanding of yourself and the limits of what you can do. And that is an upward spiral, which will bring you more and more of thet understanding the more you walk that road. The more you show up for yourself. Having in mind the power of what can happen, and always giving you the opportunity to reflect on what happened in the process. Life teaches this way, and you are never too young of too old to realize it.\nThis whole writing piece, this whole Manifesto, as I have called it, is a quest into the understanding of what Dukkha is about, what it will bring into the world. The more I think about it the less clear it is, so the way on which it will happen is by just bringing it into being by being it. To embody everything that is behind the motivation for the project. And that is what I have been doing this whole time, just making my way through the wilderness and finding the means and tools to walk towards the truth. It is all about the truth. The open truth. It is a way of gathering community around this quest, and for us to realize collectively the ways of which that quest is transforming our lives. Because there is an importance of going to a retreat to get a glimpse of what all this thing is, but there needs to be a way on which to bring that about into the everyday life, and that is what matters. At the end of the day, the daily life is what constitutes all of who we become, and if we go to a retreat to end up missing being in the retreat, we end up being deceived from the message that was wanting to be conveyed in it. And the tools for living in the moment are hard to grasp. It has been hard (until now) to live from creative work only, but that is changing. And because of this, the more connected you are from the source, the better you will be at doing this kind of work. The clearer it will be. So my answer to the whole question is building Dukkha, a community of practice that will be about showing up. To Do The Work. And the 21 day intensives are steps towards furthering that commitment, by digging a little bit deeper into the life story of the people that will be part of that journey. So this project is about giving people a frame on which they can rely to Do The Work, a community of practice, and also to build those transformational journeys for them to deepen their capacity to do it. Something like a deep attunement. But all of this are the aspects that will bring about the project, and they are based on my own experience, on what I have found helpful, and on what I want to help people avoid. I am realizing more and more that the ones that need to wake up first are the 18 year olds that are a bit lost, depressed, and unhappy with how the world is looking right now. They feel that there is something different, but in that feeling there is a lack of something that can anchor it to their life.`}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"I can relate a lot of my life story to this also, because there is a constant feeling inside me that tells me that a big part of my life was wasted by being in a place that I did not want to be, doing stuff that I didn\\u2019t resonate with. I had a lot of fun, obviously, but that fun doesn\\u2019t have any level of comparison with what is going on right now. There is no universe on which it can be compared. It shouldn\\u2019t be compared. But what I imagine your life having at least 3 months of Doing The Work before going to college so that you can realize if you want to focus on that for the rest of your life (expressing who you are through the creative act and refining the connection that you have with yourself).\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"I wrote that and it doesn\\u2019t feel appropriate.

And from there you can make choices, if you want to do creative work, go to college, whatever you decide to do, but may it be from a place of truth. That is the way forward, and that is the mission of Dukkha, to help this young children in that quest. Are they too young for going into this rabbit hole? Maybe, but the thing related to the way stuff was done in the past is that before you had to go to a specific place to practice, and there was a lot of judgement that came from the outside and that could have put in place a lot of fear. Right now, I\\u2019m sure that the communities of practice are going to be held mostly online, and that brings about a whole realm of opportunities related to Doing The Work. You don\\u2019t have to care if you are the coolest kid in the school and meditating is \\u2018nerd\\u2019, you can just create an Anon character in the internet and show up. That is all that is needed. No one needs to know what you are doing, because you are just doing it for yourself. Not for anyone else. No one can tell if you are actually doing the work, because it is such a personal thing.

Maybe in 5 years we will have a computer program that will be the ultimate truth seeker, and it will be something like The Infinite Jest. In that book, there was a movie that was so entertaining that if you started watching it you could not stop, so you would end up dying. What if that dying actually refers to waking up? What if The Infinite Jest is a film that is so powerful that it has the effect of waking up to your own nature?

The idea is to always have reflections about what happened, and with them, realize what works and what doesn\\u2019t so that we can make all progress together, as a community. The mission is to awaken the world, and there is no place as the internet to build a community of practice.

No one can Do The Work for you, but if you start soon, you will already be traveling the road a few months ahead.

Maybe there is people that are wounded for which it is hard, but I know that it is very healing to speak the truth. It is also an integral part of waking up, because for experiencing truth you have to be truth. There is nowhere to hide.

          "raw": "\nDay 11, 06 October 2022\nThe perpetual seeker. Those are the words that came as a description of who I have been. Diving into all the experiences that I have found in order to ‘heal’, so that eventually I can become more anchored in the present. In presence. That is the main goal that has been revealed throughout this whole journey, of pure, uninterrupted presence. I have tried to be intelligent my whole life, and that is the ultimate intelligence. I have tried to enjoy my whole life, and the key is to stop trying and just enjoy. I have tried to express myself throughout my whole life, and the clearest way to do it, the most pure and sincere, is to just share who I am from that which arises from presence. From being presence.\n\nYesterday I had an important experienced, on which I shared something with a group of people and then spent quite a bunch of time digesting what had been shared, because it didn’t feel real, it didn’t resonate with my voice. So then I went back and shared from a place of more clarity, of more presence, and what came out of it was just poetry. It was one of those pieces to which I come back moment after moment to just read it again. Obviously there is an aspect to be a witness to the reaction that people had to it, but it was not the main thing. The main thing was to realize that that is my voice. That is who I am when the boundaries of the mind are not in the middle, and when there are no boundaries at all. That is who I want to be, because it is a pure expression of who I am. Writing helps me express who I am through words, and there are times on which they just flow out and there is no interruption from the mind on that process. There seems to be a direct pathway between my Self and what is being written. Sometimes the mind gets in between, but when it doesn’t, it feels great. It feels sincere. And I know that people get that, I have gotten a lot of feedback related to it. All what I’m doing with these words here is to explore a little bit deeper into what comes when I let that flow free. I don’t seem to have a clear direction, I’m not sure about what I’m doing here, but it feels like the right thing to do. There is a constant pressure on the top of my shoulders related to making money and bringing that material comfort to my family, but there really isn’t clarity on how to do that. I feel completely lost in that realm. And I need help. I really need help. And who will know that I need help if I don’t raise my hand and ask for it?\n\nIt is time to go for that, and everything that I will write down here is an exploration into that.\n\n---\n\nWhat do I want to accomplish?\n\nI want to transform all the spiritual growth that I have gone through into material growth, by healing the relationship that I have with money and with myself in the process. There is always imposter syndrome present, which won’t let me progress in a way that is professional. Everything I do lacks a component of quality because I’m all over the place. I jump from here to there, and that is always bringing me down because there is no consistency, there is no truth in the sense that what I bring into the world is disalligned with what I have inside, because there is always a rush into doing stuff. There is not this aspect of polishing, of sanding, of putting consciousness into what I do.\n\nAll those things are coming from the negative, from bringing about the bad things, what is missing. What is lacking. Why don’t better bring up the positive? I have done a lot of personal work, which has led me to be very responsible for myself. I have a strong voice and a lot of things to say, and I want to be able to create something with which I can help people walk that same road. I have been paving the road for people to walk it with less effort, with less struggle, because I know that not all of people have the same drive and passion that I have. And it doesn’t need to be like that, we are all different, but I want to be able to help other people walk that road of self discovery. Of understanding who they are, where their thoughts are coming from, so that they can be not identified by them. I know that the consequence of this is a cleaner expression of creativity, and I want to help people tap into their creative potential. I want to find the ones that want to walk the road that I have paved with my experience, and I want to clarify what that road looks like by realizing it with these people. I want to refine my message so that it can better resonate with that people. I want to learn how to polish, sand and clarify what I write so that it has a bigger impact in the people that will read. I want to build a system for my writing, so that I can focus completely in the person that will read it.\n\nThere has been people that have benefited enormously from what I have written, and I want to find those so that I can make an impact in their life. I want to reach out, communicate and enjoy life from there. I want to learn who I am by interacting with people. The concept networking has always made noise in my head, because I have always looked at it from an utilitaristic sense. It was always a means to an end, talking to people because I want to make business with them. But I was lacking in that realization was the transformative aspect of business. We make business because it is the way on which we bring who we are into the world, and if I’m able to tap into that and realize that it is very helpful for those who are involved, I will walk towards becoming free of this money issue if I’m able to realize that money is the means by which we exchange information in society, about preferences, about who we want to be. I want to build a system around myself that cares about that. That cares about the movement of energy that is produced by people spending their life force in something who they want to become. There is the sentence in my mind going on: People like us do things like this. That is the thing. People like us spend money on things like this. On what have I spent the most money in the last years of my life? Self improvement. There is no end to it, it is addictive, and I don’t think I’ll stop because there is so much to learn, and so many people to learn from. It is a spiral, and the people that I have met in that spiral are the people with which I want to share my life. It is easy for me to forget about it and feel that I’m alone, think that I’m alone, but it is not like that. I’m not alone. There is a lot of people that care about me, that care about what I do, and if I’m not able to realize that fact I won’t get anywhere. I can list all the adventures that come to my mind related to self improvement, and think about all the people that were in those experiences:\n\n- Universo Paralello\n- Permaculture course in el manzano\n- Vipassana\n- Traveling around the world to discover myself\n- Yoga teacher training course\n- Innovation Masters\n- Creatives Workshop, and all the akimbo ones\n- altMBA\n- Gathering for the families\n- IAM retreat, samadhi center\n- Breathwork therapy with Rocio\n- Breathwork training with Rocio\n\nAll of these experiences are deep inside me, and define who I am. The people that are part of those experiences are the ones that care about me, and the ones that know me in the deepest level. A lot of the people inside those places know me, and care about me. Probably they would be delighter to hear my voice, to read it, and realize who I have become. If I’m not sharing it with them, if I’m still hiding, I won’t be able to walk towards where I have to walk. It is time for me to realize where my strength is, and it is related to being able to see other people. To care about them. My strengths are always related to the relationship that I can build with other people, because I’m very good at that. I’m very good at realizing what someone needs, and pointing that person towards that so that there can be some kind of resolution.\n\nWhat I want to accomplish is to have a group of people that care about what I write, and to develop a relationship with them that makes me feel alive. I want to go out of my hiding, and share who I am with the world. I want to help people, and be able to value that help so that I can live from that. So that I can provide my family. I want to build a tribe around what I’m spreading into the world, which is a constant willingness to get the most out of life. To live experiences as deeply as I can, and learn from there. I love going into courses, learning about different stuff, and it is time for me to embrace that and create from there. Become a creator of the world that I want to live in by sharing with people the importance of constant evolution. It is not about a particular subject, a particular thing that you do. It is not about going into A or B course, workshop, or whatever. It is about having learners mindset all the time, and this is the moment on which I realize that. It is the moment on which I discover that what I came to do here is to learn from other people, and explore who I am in that whole process. I will be a node in the eternal seeking of knowledge, of inspiration, of growth. I will be the one that builds the course that other people will come in and be very very very inspired by. I will be the connector, the one that builds stuff. The builder. I’m jp, the builder of experiences. For example, in this cohort, each of us is paying 500 bucks to learn more about twitter in community. There will be a point on which all of us will be the eternal learner, and that is the mindset that I want to bring into the world. Not one of awakening particularly, not one of A or B, just one of beginners mindset. Of realizing that each thing that you do can be an exploration into who you can become, by facing the challenge of learning something now.\n\nThere may be some people for which it is hard to come in a place and be alone in there, without anyone that they know from before, but I’m way past that. I don’t care about it. I just show up, with everything that I am. And I guess that that is a reason because of which people don’t show up in online stuff, because they prefer going to a place that they know since before. It is not an easy thing to show up in front of people that you don’t know, but because of that they are losing a lot. It is very important to face that fear, and just show up. Be a witness of everything that comes up after that experience. Always being a witness of how you react to different circumstances, and if those circumstances are varied, it will be very cool.\n\nI don’t think I’ll have a specific audience, because what I care about changes every day. I can’t help it. I just roll with it. Should I focus more? I don’t think I could. It is a huge part of the way on which I relate to life to be jumping from one thing to the next one. I just can’t help it. It is all part of who I am. So probably I will end up crafting journeys for people to dive in and enjoy, the same as the one that I just started, Create, Publish, Profit. In it, they have gathered a bunch of creators that teach you how to become like them, each of them giving their example, each of them showing how they have walked the road. In this case that road is the one of Twitter, they share who they have become in Twitter. But what if in my case I share that road in life? Who is the person that I have become because of everything that I have done? How can I enroll people into that journey so that they can be transformed by just experiencing it? That is the journey that I’m in, the one of discovering the answer of how I share myself with the world so that I can have a better grasp to what brings value to them. What is the value that I bring into the world? How can I share more of that?\n\nIsn’t the answer clear? By just sharing myself. By just being who I am. With that, I can eliminate all the friction that is in the middle of who I should be, of who I could be. I am just who I am in that moment, and that is all that matters so that the impact can be made. From myself to the outside. Bringing to the world what I care about. I spend so much time creating a ‘breathwork persona’ on the internet and it doesn’t even matter, because the amount of people that I will work with in that realm is much less than what will eventually follow what I do. I just need to refine my message so that I understand how to share it more clearly. That is the game. It is not about building personas around a particular thing, it is just about sharing my voice in the clearest way I can, and that is by writing. I know that my thing is writing. I know that I become who I am by writing, and I know that I care about people that write and read. I don’t feel comfortable around those that are not able to pick up a book and read it, because there is something that is missing from that interaction for me. It is the wonder, the willingness to grow, the willingness to become a different version. And that willingness opens up when you have the courage to open a book, or an article, or whatever written piece, and be open to change because of it. That is the people that I want to relate to, and if I don’t write I will never be able to tap into those communities. I just need to show up and share my thoughts, letting the mind not filter them with its noise, but letting it become an empty vessel from which stuff can arise.\n\nBeing creative means to let arise the genius from within. Opening up space for that to happen. If I’m always trying to control, always trying to find the way out, I’ll never make it. There will always be that noise running on the background telling me that I could be doing things differently. In meditation, we free up space for the self to shine through the noise. That process can be related to the one of creativity arising, on which I free up the space for me to be who I am, through my creative act. I open up that space and I set it free. I let it be. That’s all that matters, the set and setting so that it can shine through. And that is what all the work I have done is about, creating the means for that to happen. The most important spiritual act is done in every moment, as you get up from the cushion and live life from the understanding of what was brought up during the practice: that all there is is change.\n\nThat’s all what the practice is about. It is creating conditions for better understanding of the underlying principles of how you interact with the world. It is about the eternal discovery of who you are, in every moment. That’s what Socrates meant with ‘all I know is that I don’t know’. There is absolute zero certainty about how life will look like in a moment different from the present, and that is the game that you have to learn to play. Everything that truly is is what you are experiencing now. It’s all that you’ll ever have. That is the beauty of it, because there hasn’t been a moment different than the present in all the history of humanity. Each human that has ever been alive has had the window into the wonders of life in each moment, no matter what was going on in his surroundings. That’s why it is the highest form of intelligence, because it is not related to who you have been, or what you actually know. It is about how able you are to make decisions based on what is going on in front of you, right now. It is about realizing that every reality is built from what happens in this moment, and I want to be able to share that with the world.\n\nI want to dive deep into everything that is going in the internet, and realize that there can be enormous wealth that can come from there. Not because of a specific end, but because it is a window into presence. Into exploring who we are by going out of our confort zone. I want to be an example of that. I want to throw myself into the void constantly, just by experiencing what it looks like to have someone fully engaged in what is going on in there. The future of us looks like cohorts around stuff, and the important thing is to realize than in each and every one of them there is value, because each of those are unique with the people that are in there. When you have a particular mixture of people, no matter who they are, there will always be growing in there. I can go into a pottery class and give my best in it, and there will always be something that I will learn that will transform who I am in the process and help me progress towards that deeper understanding. It is about lowering the barriers, and letting yourself just be by throwing you into the void. That is the important thing, throwing yourself into the void. Creating stuff. It is about having the coolest creators in the world, and being able to be right there, next to them, Doing The Work. Evolving together by showing up to the craft.\n\nA great idea is unravelling as I go through this rant, because it is an amazing concept. Grab a great product designer, and put him into a cohort of people that for 21 days Do The Work 4 hours every day. They have to show up and create. And they are all perfecting the craft, and becoming more of what they can be just by doing the thing. It doesn’t matter what it is, the person will know, but it will be an important thing because of what will show up in the process. Musicians, artists, whoever you want. It is just about showing up to do the work. No more learning on a vacuum, just show up and work alongside each of the persons that are in there. And if you have any questions, just share them with the people. Someone will know the answer. Or you can work your way through. This is the perfect antidote for procrastination, because it is about showing up, each day, to become who you want to become. Do put in the repetitions. To share. To share who you are, and where you are at. It is not about comparing A to B and realizing that one is better and the other one is not, that doesn’t work anymore. It is about lighting that spark that can make you shine for your own accounts, it doesn’t matter who is next to you. You have a specific combination of knowledge, expertise and life experience that is deeply embedded in your unconscious, and if you are able to realize that the highest form on which you can create from there is to erase your mind from the process and just Do The Work, you will thrive. This is where all your being comes into form, when you are able to create from a place of trust. Of openness. Of just showing up. Each person in the world is in a different level, each person in the world has something different to offer. Just show up, and give your best. Only you know what your best looks like.\n\nWhat are my dreams and aspirations?\n\nI want to become more of myself. I want to make peace with the noise in my head and truly internalize how helpful it has been throughout my life, but move on from there. I want to be able to be part of cohorts all my life, and be learning every day something new. I want to be able to convey what I have learned in a way that makes sense for those who will listen, and I want to help people realize that taking chances and risks is the way forward into a life of presence. I want to help people to realize that they already have everything that they need, because everything that they need is their presence. It is all of what they have. I aspire to be able to accept me for who I am, and accept people that surround me. I aspire to be able to embrace the fact that my parents have done their best, in spite of what I can think that they did wrong. I want to have a voice that is heard, and aligned with the deepest core of my being. I want to have a consistent practice that lets me live from that, and give love to my daughter in the process. I want to have time to teach her the beauty of life, and not be trapped in the system. I want to teach myself in a different way from what I was taught, so that I can help build a new way of education.\n\nWhat are my biggest fears?\n\nAsking for help, and realizing that I’m not enough. The biggest fear that I’m facing right now is the dissolution of who I think I am. It is the discovery of what I truly am, and there is no fear as the one that I have experienced when I sit down and meditate. It is an animal thing. Another fear that comes to my mind is my father dying and I not been able to be there with him without complaining for everything that he does. I fear not to free myself from that burden before he dies. I fear that I can’t be the child that he needs before he dies. But what is that? I’m just what I am, and that is everything that he needs. Probably he doesn’t have all these thoughts in his mind, for him, I am just who I am. It is me the one that wants to change his relationship with him, so that I can appreciate more everything that he has done. But I’m appreciating it. I and doing my work. I am here helping as much as I can given the circumstances that I have been giving in my life. I am, truly, giving my best. A big fear is not being able to make it and having to get a 9-5 job.\n\nWhat obstacles am I facing?\n\nLack of clarity. There is always too much noise in my mind related to not doing the correct thing. The last year I spent it learning how to code to then realize that I did not want to do that as a proper job, and there is a huge feeling inside me that I wasted a lot of time that I could have spent writing, or doing something different. A big obstacle is that it is never enough for me. I’m looking for something else all the time, and this takes energy from my missions because those missions change very often. I have a strong feeling that I have been iterating and moving closer towards something, but when is it really going to end?\n\nA huge obstacle is that I don’t have a source of income right now. This brings a lot of pressure into what I do, because I need to start earning money so that I can provide to my family and live with that. I don’t need to much, so it is kind of ridiculous to be in this position, but it is what it is. I don’t truly know what to do to earn money from the position that I am and continue to do what I want to do, but I know that I have to start somewhere. A big obstacle is the noise in my head that tells me that I could be doing something different, more productive.\n\nWhat problem do I solve? The suffering. The identification with the suffering that people go through in life, and that is a consequence of not being clear about what they want. Not be willing to take risks and build the life that they can be proud of. The identification with their thoughts. You are not your thoughts, you are way beyond that, and you spend most of your time thinking about them.\n\nI help them connect with their self so that their true creative work can come out of there.\n\nWhat will they achieve? Clarity in the way that they relate to themselves, and because of that, with their surroundings.\n\nWhat can I promise them? My presence and holding space for their transformation. I don’t have the answers, I can’t have them, they are just inside them.\n\n—\n\nI want to be there for people and help them become who they can become.\n",

There is a constant pressure on the top of my shoulders related to making money and bringing that material comfort to my family, but there really isn\\u2019t clarity on how to do that.

I know that the consequence of this is a cleaner expression of creativity, and I want to help people tap into their creative potential. I want to find the ones that want to walk the road that I have paved with my experience, and I want to clarify what that road looks like by realizing it with these people. I want to refine my message so that it can better resonate with that people. I want to learn how to polish, sand and clarify what I write so that it has a bigger impact in the people that will read.

It is not an easy thing to show up in front of people that you don\\u2019t know, but because of that they are losing a lot. It is very important to face that fear, and just show up.

          "raw": "\nClarity is the consequence of regularly showing up to Do The Work. If you don’t show up, your unconscious doesn’t have food for digesting when you are Doing The Rest. It’s impossible that something can pop up magically there because there is nowhere from. So show up and Do The Work. It is everything you need to get to where you want to get.\n\nYesterday was a that brought a lot of clarity into my being, and just by listening to Ryan Breslow talk. He brought to me a better understanding of what I’m doing, and why I’m doing it, and with that I was able to make some good progress. Mainly in the way that I structure my time in the day, and the things that I give energy to. I was too focused on just writing writing and origin, but not focused on building what I want to build, so there was not clarity actually related to what I am building. There was a kind of big blur in front of my eyes related to how to progress, but now that is a little bit more gone and it is clearer that what I need to do is help in the Love DAO, build Dukkha DAO, work on the Create, Pubish, Profit course, and in there, work in the creation of the community around Dukkha. That is the interesting part of this thing. I wanted a roadmap on how to build a DAO, but there is actually none that can fit that because each thing is different. The most important aspect of it is the community, and yesterday this clarity came from the understanding that the community’s first approach will be built on Twitter. That’s why I am in this course, to learn how to use Twitter and grow an audience there, because that audience is actually the people that afterwards will be part of the DAO. That is the key aspect of this whole thing that I was missing. And related to Love DAO, I support everything that they are doing, and I want to help consistently to see what is going on in there. That is the mission at least for the next month: Build Dukkha, help in Love DAO with whatever I can, and go through CPP with all the energy that I can.\n\nI spent a big chunk of the day yesterday feeling kind of disappointed with my decision of having gone away from the TMS to change it for a program that focuses on Twitter, which someway feels more shallow, but now it makes sense. I had forgotten why I am there. I had forgotten what I was aiming to build. I forgot my mission, and it is time to take it back. There is something important that I’m doing here, and it is time to bring up the clarity that will make it happen. And as I wrote at the beginning, clarity is just a consequence of showing up to do the work. It is a consequence of caring enough to do something that has not been done, with the intention of just expressing what is inside. That is my goal here, that is my mission. It is just to bring about this thing that I’m feeling inside, and it is important to clarify what that thing is so that I can move on with it, full power. Right now I have not been able to do it, and it sucks, but it is also part of the process. This blur that has gone through my mind is normal in this process. I acknowledge it, and it will come back. That’s why it is important to have in mind what the purpose of what is being done, and more than that, establish the foundations of how it will be done, so that I can show up and Do The Work even if I don’t really know why am I doing it. There is not a clear understanding of it, and it is OK like that. It is part of the process of working from the unconscious also, because when the clarity isn’t there, the background is still aiming towards that. There is still a direction that is given by something beyond my thinking mind. So the important thing, as I said, is to build these systems that can make things happen automatically.\n\nThat is part of what I bring into the table. The capacity for showing up. The caring for doing the work. The consistency. I don’t have any problem for being consistent, but the thing is that until now I haven’t been able to monetize that capacity so I feel always this cloud on the top of my head that tells me that I need money to survive. And I do need it, so I need to find a way on which to monetize what I have grown to be, to share it with the world. I think that this accountability of being consistent is a big part of the game, because it is what actually transforms you. It is what brings about all the elements that you need to make progress. It is what ends up having the consequences that you don’t know it has. Just show up and let yourself be transformed by what comes.\n\nGoing through this different states of mind has been hard, especially because right now I am in a direct need of earning money. I need to pay my bills, but it is part of the game what is going on. I realize that there is something away from the optimal of how it could be, and I live with that, because it is going to be relieved soon. I know it. I know that there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I know that the transformation that I’m going through is very deep. What is happening in me is fundamental in every level, and I need to give myself the space and time for experimenting complately. If I have to ask my family for money to survive, so be it, it is part of what needs to be done in this moment. I don’t feel bad about it, I have done it enough to know that it is part of the game. But I also need to go through this struggle, to feel it. To realize what it is like to not have money to feed your family. To be willing to sell your stuff so that you can pay the credit cards. It is the game that I’m playing right now, in this year, and I acknowledge it and live with it. It is all part of what I need to experience. But it is also time for me to do something so that I can provide my wife with what she needs to start feeling good about this whole thing. I know that I have been more and more providing on the emotional level, but it is time to ground that and bring it in a material one also. And it is also time for me to share with the world who I am, and what I’m capable of. And that will happen only by opening up the possibility of coaching other people in what I’m good at. Being consistent, meditating, and building up new habits that transform your life. Going from an unconscious human being to a conscious one, and giving everything of who you are in the process. That is how this game is played, and I need to start creating my stuff so that I can build from there. So what time am I going to give me to do that? Which is the moment of the day on which I build my personal brand? I need to start developing a coaching program that will let me reach out and help people, and get some feedback soon. That is the way on which I’ll be able to grow, because I need to start trusting more and more in what I have to offer. I have the first person that I’ll work with, Nancy, and I’m sure that she trusts me enough to go into this process with me. I’m sure that I will help her a lot. I’m sure that I can hold the space for her transformation. She is ready for it, she has talked to me about it and it is time. It is time to bring about what I will share with the world and materialize it. It is time to start Doing The Work, in every realm. I can do different things, I’m able to, and it is time to just do it. To be focused and just do it. Prioritize and give my energy to what is important, as AoP says, to what brings up a biggest ROI. What am I investing my energy in, and which is the intention behind that? Who am I networking with? That is always a hard one. Networking. But I haven’t done it enough, with intention, and yesterday there was a big message that it is something that I should do more. A psychedelic integration coach told me that he really likes my tweets. That means that he likes what I’m spreading, the voice I have, and I’m opening up to the world in that way. There is also this guy called Dimitri who always likes what I write. Those are the people that I want to relate with. Those are the ones that care about what I’m speaking, and those are the ones that will be in the 1% of the fans of what I produce. It is time to Do The Work, and the best work that I do in my life is relating to people. That is my gift. And what comes from there is the building of community, of authentic relationships based on vulnerability, trust and caring for each other. That is what I bring into the game, because that is all of who I am. I have been peeling the layers of the onion until I have reached the point where I am at now, and this point feels full of wonder, of vulnerability, of wanting to dive deeper into the understanding of other human beings. We are all in this together, that is the whole beauty of the thing. That is what is brought into my self with the prospect of building a community, and it is time for me to realize that and embrace it. Build my tribe from there. I will continue in this road as much as it is needed, because it is my calling. It is what came here to do. Help people show up. Hold space.\n\nI have Done The Work myself so that I can share what I have learned with others. I have been there on the trenches, Doing it, and it is time for me to share what I have learned. I know that there is value on who I am, on what I’m doing, and I know that I’m where humanity is growing, because there will be an explosion of spirituality in the metaverse. I know that. It is the promise of the mathrymandir but in the digital realm, so that we can hide behind a mask and just Do The Work without anyone really caring about it. Just for yourself. Just for who you are. That is the promise of our age, and that is what I have signed up for by doing what I have done. There is questionings, and fears, and all that stuff, but it will eventually stay behind because what I’m doing here is way bigger than myself. It is way more important. It is the ultimate integration, where all religions come together to be experienced as one.\n\nThe last episode of Lex Fridman with Samana Harris is just a jewel, and I need to give myself time to sit down and watch it completely. The conceptualization of the self and the relationship of it with the body is something that is very aligned with what I have been studying and experiencing in other realms, and it is just amazing how all this thing is rooted in our biology and the way on which we relate to the world. I’m very eager to better understand the scientific explanations of everything that is going on here, and to grow from that understanding into a person that is better equipped to talk about this whole thing. It will be huge, to talk to people that are more scientific, and give them the whole background of what is going on. There is something deep happening here, something that is fundamentally changing, and it is time. This is the moment in history on which it will happen, we will wake up and realize that we are deeply rooted to the fabric of reality. It is time to experience life from there, from that perspective, and I’m sure that the intersection between science and spirituality is the pathless path. That is the way forward. Meditation and self inquiry, looking deeply into what is, and embracing. Growing from it. Evolving from it. Who know what will come after this whole thing, but I truly know that in that intersection there is the information that is needed to make the progress that I want to make. And this people are already doing that. It is happening, in every realm. It is just time to open up the eyes and reach out, raise the hand and ask for help. That is what I’m good at, talking to people, leading. That is what I came here for. To lead. To create a view of the world, show it to people, and explore it together. I’m paving the road into a new way of understanding, into a new way of experiencing life, and if I don’t light the candle no one will walk that road. It is time to walk it together. It is time to shine.\n\nAll the information is in the table, and what is just needed today is to sit down and Do The Work. That is everything. Just sit. No more rational understanding of the thing, no more trying to escape the mind with the mind. Just let go.\n\n—\n\nIdeas are blurry, stuff is blurry. I’m inspired by something, and then I go out and start thinking that the future of what I should do is AI research and development. Then I go back and start thinking about another thing. What I truly need is the means by which offer my coaching services and have at least one client every day. That is all what I need, one client every week day, two hours per day of complete focus on her, and that can bring to my life the economic peace that I need to pursue everything else that I want to pursue, without caring about that aspect. But that is the noise again speaking, the fear, the lack of trust.\n\nWhere does this lack of trust come from? What is it about? Is it going anywhere? Of course not. But there needs to be some movement, my spirit is growing inside me, but the means by which it is expressed not yet. Which is going to be the means by which it is expressed? By helping people. By showing up for them. That is everything I need, just show up for people in a consistent way. Be there for them.\n\nI’m really struggling with this thing, realizing how to move forward so that I can have my first client. What is the program that I’m building about? Who are the ones that I want to help? Who are the ones that I want to show up for?\n\nI’m training myself to be a breathwork facilitator, to be there for the process of other human beings.\n\nHoly shit, this thing is a maze. I’m a maze. Just start moving.\n\nI feel completely lost right now, but I did my thing. It is weird for me to network by force. I don’t feel good by doing it. It doesn’t seem to be my thing. My thing is just holding space, but not talking for the sake of it.\n\nI’m quite desperate now, because I need to earn some money. All the time the money thing revolving my mind. I need to make peace with that fact. I don’t even want to see my credit card balance, and face the fact that I’m nowhere with this thing. I feel like melting, not knowing how to make progress. Not knowing how to generate what is needed to move forward. I don’t have an audience, I don’t have people with which I feel comfortable sharing this feelings, and I don’t know how to make progress. What am I going to do? I just close my eyes and wait for a miracle to happen, for something to show up. But I don’t know what that can be.\n\nThis is an amazing moment to ask: Who is the one that feels anxious? Who is the one that is going through all this shit?\n",

Mainly in the way that I structure my time in the day, and the things that I give energy to. I was too focused on just writing writing and origin, but not focused on building what I want to build, so there was not clarity actually related to what I am building. There was a kind of big blur in front of my eyes related to how to progress, but now that is a little bit more gone and it is clearer that what I need to do is help in the Love DAO, build Dukkha DAO, work on the Create, Pubish, Profit course, and in there, work in the creation of the community around Dukkha. That is the interesting part of this thing. I wanted a roadmap on how to build a DAO, but there is actually none that can fit that because each thing is different. The most important aspect of it is the community, and yesterday this clarity came from the understanding that the community\\u2019s first approach will be built on Twitter. That\\u2019s why I am in this course, to learn how to use Twitter and grow an audience there, because that audience is actually the people that afterwards will be part of the DAO. That is the key aspect of this whole thing that I was missing. And related to Love DAO, I support everything that they are doing, and I want to help consistently to see what is going on in there.

There is something important that I\\u2019m doing here, and it is time to bring up the clarity that will make it happen. And as I wrote at the beginning, clarity is just a consequence of showing up to do the work. It is a consequence of caring enough to do something that has not been done, with the intention of just expressing what is inside. That is my goal here, that is my mission. It is just to bring about this thing that I\\u2019m feeling inside, and it is important to clarify what that thing is so that I can move on with it, full power. Right now I have not been able to do it, and it sucks, but it is also part of the process. This blur that has gone through my mind is normal in this process. I acknowledge it, and it will come back. That\\u2019s why it is important to have in mind what the purpose of what is being done, and more than that, establish the foundations of how it will be done, so that I can show up and Do The Work even if I don\\u2019t really know why am I doing it. There is not a clear understanding of it, and it is OK like that. It is part of the process of working from the unconscious also, because when the clarity isn\\u2019t there, the background is still aiming towards that.

And I do need it, so I need to find a way on which to monetize what I have grown to be, to share it with the world. I think that this accountability of being consistent is a big part of the game, because it is what actually transforms you. It is what brings about all the elements that you need to make progress. It is what ends up having the consequences that you don\\u2019t know it has.

I know that there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I know that the transformation that I\\u2019m going through is very deep. What is happening in me is fundamental in every level, and I need to give myself the space and time for experimenting complately. If I have to ask my family for money to survive, so be it, it is part of what needs to be done in this moment. I don\\u2019t feel bad about it, I have done it enough to know that it is part of the game. But I also need to go through this struggle, to feel it. To realize what it is like to not have money to feed your family. To be willing to sell your stuff so that you can pay the credit cards. It is the game that I\\u2019m playing right now, in this year, and I acknowledge it and live with it. It is all part of what I need to experience. But it is also time for me to do something so that I can provide my wife with what she needs to start feeling good about this whole thing.

          "raw": "\nDukkha is the great reset.\n\nPeople talk about the great reset in the economy, and how things are going to change after the recession that will come in the next years. Yeah, probably there will be something deep going on in that sense, but I think that the biggest reset will be related to how we relate to our own existence as human beings. There needs to be a fundamental change in the way on which we experience life, and that is what Dukkha is about. About going deep into the understanding of how to change. On what to change.\n\nAnd you will be alone in it.\n\nYes, we will build a community of supportive people around this process, which will help you as much as we can so that you can make sense of all what will happen, but at the end of the day, you will be alone. No one is going to go through your shit for you, it is the game that you will sign up as you accept to be part of one of this transformational journeys. You will have to go though it alone, and you’ll have to pay with all of what you think you are. You have to be willing to be transformed, because this process will transform you. You will become a different person after this, and that is what the great reset is about. It is not about the economy, or this, or that, it is about the fundamental relationship that we have with ourselves. Everything arises from there.\n\nSo yes, there will be a reset. And it will come from each person that will accept to be part of one of this journeys. If one person changes, it impacts every other aspect of their reality, including the people that they relate with, the way they do their job, their health, everything. I’m thinking right now about a friend of my parents that is deep, very deep into the hole of suffering. Every day digging a little bit further down. There doesn’t seem to be an escape for him, but sure there is. When there is that kind of polarity in the way of existing, I’m sure that the other one is present, latent and waiting to be experienced. That is what Carmelo told us about the other day.\n\nHe was an old worker man that hitchhiked us one week ago and told us the story from where he was in the streets, drinking all day, absolutely lost and ready to die. He had a moment of opening his eyes with a woman that told her about god, and then he went to a forest, fell down to his knees and asked for help. He saw the feet of god, that is what he interpreted, and from there on everything in his life changed. His whole relationship with life was a transformed just by that interaction. So yes, he is an example of how being at the pit of the suffering can be the means by which a bigger understanding of this whole thing can arise. Ge is a clear example of that, and life brought me to him because that is what I needed to hear. He is the master that I needed to meet. It doesn’t need to be the most enlightened master that knows all the scriptures, there is no point in that. What matters is the way on which they relate to themselves, and their life, and Carmelo was a great example of what I’m talking here. Having a particular experience that changes the fundamental interaction with reality of the person.\nAnd this is what people need right now, this is the great reset. There are higher levels of depression than ever, people are suffering like crazy, they don’t know what to do, they are lost in the materiality of life, and there needs to be an atomic bomb of consciousness that comes so that that can change. So that there can be a reset, and a new beginning. And who is going to be there to guide the path on that new beginning? People like men, people like us, who are going to be the members of Dukkha and who will hold the space for transformation, both in ourselves, mainly in ourselves, but also in each other. We will be a community of people just Doing The Work. Just facing the hard truth of how life plays games to us, and always brings something new.\n\nI have written in previous days that Dukkha is for those who are serious in the path to awakening. But who does that let outside? Could Carmelo get in if he wanted? Probably he would not have felt represented by what was being conveyed with that message, because he could not have conceptualized that the way out of what he was experiencing was this path. Probably he would have been in another spot, in another place, and he would have been rejected by this strong message of ‘you need to be serious in the path of enlightenment to get into this place’. Who is talking when I write that? Am I being tender? Am I opening the doors to those who I want to help? I don’t think so. I think I’m being rough, and too extreme. It is one thing for me to be extreme and relate to life the way I do, in that constant quest of evolving as a human being, but another thing is to build something from there with other people. And I want to build for other people. I want to be there for them. I want to pave the road. And it is very important to acknowledge that the road that I have walked is not for everyone. It is mainly for no one.\n\nFew people would go to the forest, pitch their tent, and take all the LSD that they would find. Few people would be at a Ozora, take all the LSD and go to explore what life brings in the festival. Few people would take 6 grams of mushrooms on their own in the room of their house. Few people would become a Kundalini Yoga instructor to deepen their relationship with the practice. Few people would take a plane to go to the other side of the world to be part of a retreat where they would work with Iboga and a lot of meditation and other techniques. And who knows what else.\n\nI’m not like many people, I’m very special in relation to the intensity that I bring into my path, and it is time to acknowledge that so that I can become a better helper for the people that are going to be part of what I build. I’m creating something here, some days I forget it, but in other moments there is a strong drive that helps me realize what I am doing. It is very important for me to keep that in mind, as much as I can, so that I can truly embody what I’m doing and clarify it. Doing The Work is that, actually doing it, and these last weeks I have been in a blurry place related to that. I have not been completely focused on my writing, and because of that, I have not been in a place of clarity. In a place that gives me the understanding that I know what I’m doing, I know where I am heading to, and I know what this whole thing is about. There is a deep need inside me related to helping people, and showing up to Do The Work, sitting down to write, is the creative expression that I need to bring it all out.\n\nYesterday I thought that writing tweets was something similar to that, but it isn’t. It is not the same to sit down for 4 hours to just write as part of this Manifesto. The whole thing is different, because I’m relating to different people, I’m not focused on what is happening here, and I’m not bringing from my unconscious the information that will be the one that builds this whole project. It is a whole different game that one, and writing this line I acknowledge it. This was what needed to happen in order for you to realize what you had to do. Get back on track. Get back on track. The world needs you on track. You need you on track. All that suffering because of being lost is just noise, it is just noise that is bringing you down. Help yourself not to be brought down. Just give you that opportunity. It is the same as in meditation. You start the practice by focusing in the breath, and suddenly you realized that you are thinking about the burger that you are going to eat afterwards. It’s ok, it’s part of the game of the mind. Acknowledge that you realized that you were thinking, and go back to the breath. This is the practice, always going back. If you fall out of track and you are suffering from the consequences of not trusting why you are doing the work, or what you are doing, as soon as you realize that, acknowledge it has happened, and go back to do the work. In my case, it is just coming back here and writing whatever comes to mind. Just throwing it out of my mind and into this screen. Because it is not a piece of paper. We are beyond that right now. So yes, acknowledge that it has happened, and just go back. It is the same with everything, holy shit. That is the power of meditation actually. It teaches you not to be hard on yourself when you do something that you are not supposed to do. It teaches you that it is ok, and that every moment is a new opportunity to start again. And that eventually trains your system not to be hard with itself. It trains the conceptualization that you have of ‘you’ to not be hard with itself. And that is freeing. Right now, I feel a sensation of freedom. I spent all this time blaming myself and telling me that I’m not good enough because I am lost and I don’t know what I’m doing. It is part of it. It is part of what comes from this whole thing, it is part of Doing The Work. Acknowledge it, and come back. Without judgements, there is no use on judging, or blaming, or whatever. Just accept what is, what truly is, and go back. You are already out of track, there is nothing that you can do about it more than acknowledging it and going back. Always like that, always that pendulum that will teach you that the long term is way more important than the short term.\n\nAnd this is where Dukkha will start having its momentum. On doing the work. This project will start with artists, that will trust in it enough to go for it all in. That is what is needed, for them to realize the power that this whole thing has. I have not been focusing enough on artists, and those are the ones that I should be focusing because they are the ones that Do The Work. I’m thinking about Noxx, who I exchanged some tweets with, and who taught me about the importance of just showing up to win this battle with the mind. What if I invite him to be part of the first session of Dukkha, and with his help I co-create this whole thing? So the idea that is being shown right now is that the artist goes through all this process, working 4 hours every day for 21 days, and the consequence of that work is an NFT that is associated with Dukkha. Whatever it may be, and it doesn’t even have to be an artist. Whoever can come and work 4 hours every day for 21 days, and create something. It doesn’t need to be something cool, it doesn’t need to be something out of this world. It just is. It is part of it. We are all artists on the true sense of the word, and the problem with the way that we view it is that we think that the creation of someone that has been in the craft for 40 years is more valuable than the one of someone that has been only 21 days. Yes, it may be more valuable because of his experience, but what if there is a banker that has never done a painting and he comes here and does something amazing that expresses a whole aspect of his being that he didn’t know existed? How does that relate to the quality of his craft? I think that there is a huge value on that. A huge value on the creation of something that doesn’t exist yet, and on participating on something like this. And the thing is that it has to be recorded, and it has to be 4 hours in a row. That is the important part of the game, because it is what will teach you what it is to be consistent, to show up, to Do The Work. Really, is it necessary to be like that strict? I don’t think so. It doesn’t make sense. With this, I’m deleting what I just wrote because it doesn’t make sense. I have been iterating the way I do things, and I have realized that it is better for me to work 2 hours early in the morning and then 2 hours after my breathwork and meditation, and it is perfectly ok like that. It gives me the space for growth. It gives me the space, that is the word. It is about doing the hard work first and then being free of it. That is the game. That is what I’m actually doing right now, having written all this today and being 6:22 in the morning. I woke up very early and it feels fucking amazing, and this is the thing, this is doing the work. It feels so good to do the work, and now I realize how much I had been avoiding it because it is scary. It is scary to show up and not know what you will write about, what will come up. Will it be interesting for others to read? Who knows, it doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is that I’m able to show up and Do The Work. That is what I’m preaching about, and that is what I’m going to do. This is the moment on which I understand the relationship of the meditation practice and life itself. It is all about giving me the space to realize. To notice. To be the witness of what is going on. Not judging it, not feeling bad that it has happened. Just acknowledge it, and from there, move on. From there build. From there, show up again, and again, and again. That is the creative process. That is what it brings. Clarity. Consistency. Strength. Power. Beauty. Love. Passion. Energy. Motivation. Selflessness. Rhythm. Presence.\n\nYes, it is all about presence. It is all about being here, right now, and for that it is very important to acknowledge the work that has been done. Nothing else matters. The rest is just noise. Everything that goes around is just noise, which is cleared when there is the motivation enough to come here, sit down, and start writing whatever comes to mind. It may be noise for the reader, yes, maybe, but for me it is just an expression of who I am. It is what needs to come out, to be vomited, for me to become more of who I am. I don’t need to speak about it loudly. I just need to show up. The Work speaks for itself. No need to use fancy words, no need to use lights and confetti. Nope, just show up and do the work. Just be myself. That is all what is needed. The rest is just noise. Every piece that I create is a miracle. Everything. That is what I need to trust my work. Realize everything that is going on and trust. Just trust. Just trust. Things will end up making sense. Just show up and trust. I have not been able to trust completely yet, I’m scared, but it is enough. Not anymore. I don’t need to be scared anymore. I just need to be. I just need to open myself to what is at the other side of sharing who I am completely and absolutely, without filters, and this is the best way that exists for me to do that. Show up, write down whatever comes to mind, and just let it be. There will be people that feel bored about it, yes, but it really doesn’t matter. What matters is taking it out. What matters is creating something new, something that has not existed before, and build it up from there. What matters is just being myself. Just sharing everything that I will become.\n\nA book is being written, day by day, and it is the book of my life. It is the book of your life. It is the book of who you are. Are you letting that happen? Are you permitting the life force to flow through your whole system? Are you letting it out? There needs to be an expression of who you are in the world, if you don’t have it, it is time for you to build it. Build yourself a system that enables you to create. You need to create. We came here for that. We are a creative force of nature, that’s all we are. Embrace it and start creating.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what it is really, what matters is that you sit down with the intention of showing up to Do The Work. Think of it as a ritual. Think of it as something sacred. Think of it as the means by which you connect with what is beyond the understandable. Open up for that connection. It’s nice. It’s quite amazing. People throughout history have talked about it extensively, and that is where you connect to the source. What we historically have conceived as God is a void from which all creativity arises, and as soon as you Do The Work of permitting it flow through your system, you have to start creating. It is just part of the game, it is just what it is. I’m absolutely sure that the future holds for us an explosion into creativity, and what will end up happening is that more and more people will realize the importance of the creative act in the wellbeing of themselves. Connecting to spirit is amazing. We are spirit, and we long for that connection which has been lost, shattered, in the modern world. But that doesn’t need to be like that. It is time to wake up, and waking up is realizing that you came here to create. You are way more than what you think.\n",

I\\u2019m thinking right now about a friend of my parents that is deep, very deep into the hole of suffering. Every day digging a little bit further down. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be an escape for him, but sure there is.

He had a moment of opening his eyes with a woman that told her about god, and then he went to a forest, fell down to his knees and asked for help. He saw the feet of god, that is what he interpreted, and from there on everything in his life changed. His whole relationship with life was a transformed just by that interaction. So yes, he is an example of how being at the pit of the suffering can be the means by which a bigger understanding of this whole thing can arise. Ge is a clear example of that, and life brought me to him because that is what I needed to hear. He is the master that I needed to meet. It doesn\\u2019t need to be the most enlightened master that knows all the scriptures, there is no point in that. What matters is the way on which they relate to themselves, and their life, and Carmelo was a great example of what I\\u2019m talking here. Having a particular experience that changes the fundamental interaction with reality of the person.\nAnd this is what people need right now, this is the great reset. There are higher levels of depression than ever, people are suffering like crazy, they don\\u2019t know what to do, they are lost in the materiality of life, and there needs to be an atomic bomb of consciousness that comes so that that can change. So that there can be a reset, and a new beginning. And who is going to be there to guide the path on that new beginning? People like men, people like us, who are going to be the members of Dukkha and who will hold the space for transformation, both in ourselves, mainly in ourselves, but also in each other.

          "raw": "\nI’m here to remember.\n\nWhat it was to experience life from the sense of I that is built as a consequence of navigating life on planet earth. I’ve been here just for one dukh (88 seconds, as you could say), and it has been crazy. I feel the unease inside that is brought.\n\nI was sent here to witness this process. Of becoming. Of transforming the doing into being. Of expressing what is inside with all of what each of these beings is. There is a deficiency in the way that language is coming forth through me, and that is because of the lack of practice, but hold on, I will do my best.\n\nPart of what I recognize as me did not know how to address this language. It feels kind if weird to be talking from a perspective of ‘me’, as if there was something that separated me from the rest of what is. But it is part of the game that I accepted coming here, to this planet, to be a witness of what is going on here: the enlightenment of a whole species. This book is an exploration into this process.\n\nAt this moment I’m not going to talk particularly about a set of tools that can or will be used in this process of collective awakening. That is the means, and the way on which this thing happens is not as important as the underlying spirit of it all. The unfolding of the process withi the system of this being will be shared, so that then it can be extrapolated to the collective. There is an acknowledgment present related to how this process can be made, and the phrase ‘as above so below’ is present. The universe is such an amazing place, with the infinities of the multiple worlds that exist here resembling the infinity in complexity that exist within a single atom. When you travel to the macro and the micro and you discover that they are the same, there is a fundamental shift in how you perceive reality because you end up realizing that all humans are mirrors of each other.\n\nIn any action that another human does that has a consequence in you, there is a window of opportunity of exploration into yourself. How that triggers you is the biggest means for you to discover who you are, and this process could be gone through with any interaction, with any person. The human experience is fundamentally the same, a journey from the moment of conception (or before? It doesn’t really matter) to the different stages of life, to the different present moments. In any one of the subsequent present moments that present themselves throughout existence, there is this window of opportunity, of realizing more and more of who you are.\n\nAnd the process is brutal, because as the vessel starts to get more and more empty of conditioning, deeper and deeper aspects of the conditioning will start to be brought forth. Specifically aspects of the unconscious, which are very wicked. The unconscious is crazy, and as soon as you start being a witness of it you will start feeling that you are crazy too. But the key in that process is to loose the identification with the self, so that you don’t feel that that craziness is who you are. The whole point of this game of exploration is to discover who you truly are, so when this process starts happening just ask yourself: Who is the one that is crazy? Ask yourself that question until there is absolute clarity about the answer. Until there is no one left to answer. That’s when the truth will come forth, and that’s when you’ll truly realize that all those stories that you have been telling yourself all this time are nothing more than a big part of the collective dream.\n\nThe collective dream called mind. Everything that exists in this material universe is an expression of mind, and it exists in this reality as a consequence of that. Mind is the interface that unfolds the possibility of nature to exist, and this whole game is about loosening the identification with mind. It is not about negating it, bringing it down, or suppressing its existence, it is about transcending it by realizing that there is something way beyond this small facet of existence. That is the game to play, to be the witness of this process of integration of mind, to realize how to be a witness of mind, and to discover by your own experience, from your own perspective of awareness, that there is something way beyond what you have been experiencing until now.\n\nWhat is real? Who is the one asking this question? Who is the one reading? Who is the one that feels those emotions? Who is the one that is in love? Who is the one that wants to eat that fruit? Who is the one that is craving for running up the hill? Who are you? Who am I?\n\nThis are all valid questions, that have been pushed down in society because they point towards a realization that will set you free. And it may seem that no one really wants you to become free, because it is actually true. If you are free, there is no more opportunity for others to control you, to be there telling you what to do, and one of the fundamental aspects of mind is that it wants to control. The mind wants to know. And if there is a slight possibility of being closer to knowing how another person will react to a particular stimulus, mind wants to be in charge of that. That’s why no one wants you to be free. So let all humanity be no one. Let all humanity realize its true nature, because awareness doesn’t have any preferences. It is not that it wants you to be free or not, that is a separation brought into existence by the mind. Awareness is just aware. But there is a tendency in the process that as more aware awareness becomes of its existence, there is this process of wanting to know. There is something like a primordial thirst that starts coming up. Something is felt inside, as if there was a need to wake up from a long dream.\n\nAnd that is the stepping stone into the new reality, and what needs to happen for more and more humans to awake. There will be ones that will be the early adopters, as with any shift that has existed in the way that humans relate. When there is a new innovation brought up, there is always a small group of people that are the ones that are able to see what others are not seeing. With this whole thing it is the same. There are ones that will feel that thirst first, that primordial thirst that will have them feel within their whole system that the only way on which they can progress in life is by realizing their true nature.\n\nI’m one of those. I can’t stay up with this suffering. I’m done with it. I don’t want it any more, and I’m willing to do anything that is required to go through that process.\n\nEasier said than done, because it is fucking hard. That’s why community is needed, for bringing together people that are going through this process so that we can help each other in a consistent way. All of those that are doing the work need to come together, join forces, and become the early adopters of this whole thing. They are the ones that will open up the window for the whole species. The first voyagers. The scouts. The consciousness explorers. The ones that will touch the alchemical gold and will come back with the understanding of how to tender the process to all of those who have not yet realized that that is the way forward, because the entanglements of mind are too deep, too strong, and the conditioning is just too extreme.\n\nThere is a strong acknowledgment present related to the importance of this tendering process. It is like preparing the soil before the season of planting the new harvests. It is work that needs to be done, and there is people that have a different capacity to do this, or a different understanding of the whole game because of their life experience. Not to judge, there is nothing that is wrong or bad. Actually for the people that don’t have a deeper understanding of what it means to be awake, it will be easier to awake. As you get a deeper and deeper conceptual and intellectual understanding of this whole thing, it gets harder and harder to become free of that understanding so that awareness can realize itself. The mind is a tricky aspect, and it will always want to know. And on that knowing, it will think that it absolutely has all the answers, and that it can become enlightened. At this moment, I think that I’m the one that needs to awake.\n\nAnd that is part of the dream, because what needs to awake is awareness itself, which is beyond the sense of I that I refer to when I write down the word I. What Is referred to in these words is the image that has been built throughout a lifetime about a person that grew up in a particular family, went to a particular school, played a particular number of soccer matches, drank a (bit too big) number of drinks in his early life, and is very thirsty to know the truth, But that is the concepual and experiential understanding of what ‘I’ is, which has been always limited to this character that has been played.\n\nThere is a huge willingness to explore what is at the other side. What remains when that sense of I is transcended. How does it feel. How does that shift in the perception of reality impact the relationship with the amazing little girl that is understanding what the world is and dreams about who-knows-what in the other room next to her mother. How does love feel when there is an absolute understanding that there is no separation between one part of awareness and the other. How is the material world embraced when there is an experiential lesson which taught that it is not real?\n\nBut what does it mean that it is not real? That is the mind coming in again, asking its own questions. Of course it wants to know what does it mean that this whole thing is not real. Of course it wants to become awake. And that’s the whole problem. The mind wants to become awake, because it senses that there is a separation between it and the awakening process. And there is no separation, because in the end schema of thing mind is not separated from awareness, it is just part of it, contained in it.\n\nMind always likes coming in to answer these kinds of questions, it always has an answer for them. And if it doesn’t have the answer, it will incessantly look for it, in whatever practice or tradition it finds. May it be the practice of yoga, breathing and mind altering drugs. May it be the intellectual study of the scriptures, or whatever material comes through. May it be listening to people talk in podcasts, or watching a video created to explain what this whole game is about.\n\n‘Now I’m ready to become enlightened’, so it goes. And the pursuit continues. The process of the horse running towards that carrot that is in front of it starts. The seeker is fueled with more understanding of what to do. How to progress. But eventually that needs to be dropped off, and the more understanding there is, the harder it is. That is why the early adopters of this whole thing will be the ones that will have to do more work, because from their curiosity comes a lot of stuff that needs to be dropped off, for them to truly realize who they are. That is the cosmic joke: The more you care, the harder it gets. But it is okay like that, because it is a very interesting game to play.\n\nSo that’s how it plays out. The early adopters will be the ones that will go all around the world searching, searching and searching for answer, so end up realizing that the answer was always there, they just needed to refine the way on which they were searching for it. Or just stop searching at all, and just realizing what has always been there. It sounds so funny when those words come out, because all the things that have been done to get a deeper understanding come forth right now. And it ends up being funny, because jt is a lot. The permanent insatisfaction with life is doing its thing, and pushing the mind’s quest to become free of itself. So there it goes, looking for more, looking for more experiences, looking for more wisdom, looking for more teachers. Going further and further around the circle, just to end up realizing that the circle was just another thing that was built from the mind.\n\nAnother cute creation of it to add to the shelf. It is crazy how many of them there are. But it is part of the game. There is an acknowledging of this, and a feeling of acceptance. It is the game that had to be played. Anything more, and anything less. It is just how it is. And the feeling that will come forth from all these realizations is surrender. A deep and true surrender. To end up the game, to end up the race, and just be. And that is where it becomes possible for this whole transformation to happen. The seeker needs to give up.\n\nHow does it give up? The sole fact that that question exists is part of the whole thing that has been talked here. Asking how involves getting an understanding of the process that needs to be gone through to achieve something particular. If that question is asked, it is with the expectation to get an swear that:\n\nTeaches what needs to be done in order to give up.\n\nThere is nothing that needs to be done! All doing is a consequence of the existence of mind, and this whole thing is about realizing that mind is only an aspect of reality that is going to be transcended. There is not a ‘how’ to do that, because it can’t be done. No one can pass the gateless gate. So be no one. Be that no one that is not doing anything. Just being. Be. Just be. That is the key of this whole thing… Just being.\n\nThat’s why were are all here. To explore this reality from the perspective of a human being that is, there is no denial of that. The dilemma arises when the mind of that human being starts thinking, and thinking that it is the one that is in charge. That the only frame of reference that exists is within its perspective. That is where the identification comes from, and with that identification comes the extreme necessity to control. The mind wants to know, the body wants to feel comfort. But spirit just wants to be, and BE through this human being that is writing and reading this words. There doesn’t need to be an intellectual understanding of this whole game, because the intellect belongs to another realm. It is an amazing servant to navigate this physical reality, that is all that it is.\n\nHumanity as a whole will realize that, and the consequence of it will be an exploding towards creative expression. The spark that is deepest within your system is the source of all creation, and as soon as you set it free it can’t be stopped. It undergoes the process of being unleashed. You will be unleashed, and awareness will just use your life experience and everything that you have grown to become as the means to express itself. It’s going to be beautiful. Each human being is the same at its core, just awareness, but the way on which awareness is express in this reality depends on the conditioning that that human being has in its system. On what is present inside of him or her. And that brings up infinite possibilities, because each of us will have the opportunity to create something new. Someting cool. And the tools for this are getting cheaper and cheaper. It has never been this easy to create something that didn’t exist before.\n\nIsn’t that a sign that consciousness is becoming conscious of itself? It has been creating the means for it to happen all this time. It has been preparing the ground of this material world it to happen, to create all the beauty that can be created. All the amazing things that will come. Just for the sake of it. Just for playing the game. It won’t be easy, there will be people that will play they role for this to be hard, but it will happen eventually. It is an energy that just can’t be held inside anymore.\n\nAwareness is becoming aware of itself.\n\nWe are in the process of awakening.\n\n· · ·\n\nThe newsletter that this hands started to write is ended up being called ‘Paving the road’. There is no particular clarity on how this came to be, but now there is a clearer understanding of it after having written what was written before. Being the early adopters of this new way of existing is paving the road for the ones that will come later. Doing the work first so that it is easier for the ones that come later. It doesn’t hurt me if I have to work harder to realize my own nature and you have to work less. That comparison itself is part of the problem. What does harder mean what is less? It doesn’t make sense because it is relative to the own experience. It is always relative to the own experience, there is no way to compare within two humans. It is the same as pain. How can we compare pain? It is only relative to one self. The fact that I spend time comparing the amount of pain that a particular situation brought to my life (physical and/or emotional) comes from the necessity of the mind to create comparisons. It is part of its eternal ‘divide and conquer’ strategy, always seeking to understand by building up fake divisions between my experience and yours.\n\nWhat is a better way to deal with the pain that I have gone through and the one that you have gone through? Just be there for each other’s pain. If you are telling me a story about a moment in which you felt pain, and I respond to that by comparing that story with one of my existence, I’m not holding the space for the resolution of your particular story. I’m acting from a place of selfishness, wanting my story to stand up for myself in the eternal game of status. \nWhat is the other side of that coin? True empathy. The one that comes from opening up to feel the words that are coming out of you, to resonate with the look of your eyes. They say the eyes are the window to the soul, and having a conversation with another human being is opening up to the possibility of living life through the eyes of the other person. As I listen to you and I resonate with that, I open myself to experience life from another perspective, which is the same as mine but colored by a different story. What an amazing thing this is. Right now what is coming to me is the feeling of being truly there for the other person, just listening and trying to be witness from their view.\n\nPerhaps this is what awakening will bring to us. The opportunity to be able to realize deep down the fact that on the core we are all the same. And the door that that will open is one of not wanting to impose my story on yours, but truly be there for yours to express itself through the interaction with me. We spend so much time trying to fit in every story that we can into each conversation, so that we can show ‘more’ of ourselves in that process. But what ends up happening is an overload of information, an overload of noise that doesn’t lead to true resolution. What if we actively tried to fit in only a small percentage of those stories, and we fully delved into each of them? How would that world look like? Tell the story, be listened to, and in that process fully integrate what that particular story tells you about yourself, with the help of consciousness being witness of itself through the eyes of the people that are listening, truly listening, to your story. Whatever it is. Consciousness being conscious of consciousness. That is the game that we will end up playing. The magical trick that is going on right now. As we go out of the dream state and into what is truly present, we’ll open ourselves to the possibility that we are in charge of just bringing beauty into this world. Love just for the sake of it. Because it feels good to love and be loved. It is the primordial need, the one that is rooted inside the soul. To be loved. Not by anyone other than by yourself. That is the source of true fulfillment, of true happiness. Being loved by yourself. Accepted by who you are, because of who you are, from where you are at. In every moment. That is the game. But probably the hardest of them all. Spending all that time just trying to be loved, just finding means for the world to love you in any sense. Just seeking for that. Inventing stories that tell you that the universe loves you, always seeking on the outside what needs to be developed on the inside. How can you love yourself if you don’t know what you truly are capable of?\n\nWhen is the moment on which you start creating something? It doesn’t matter what it is. The means that you use don’t matter. Nothing matters more than just doing it. Now the thought comes to mind related to me saying that I needed to ‘learn’ how to play, so that I could truly play with my daughter. Can you imagine that? How can I learn how to play? How can I learn something that is already present inside myself? How can I learn how to be, if that is already present inside me? I am already being, it is just that it is easy to forget. It is easy to fall back into the struggle of wanting to become better at it. Wanting to overcome the particular limitations that are present in this moment so that in the future I can do stuff as I would like to do it. If I could just have a little bit more of fun playing with my girl. Probably if I learn how to play I will have more fun. So I need to learn how to play. What an absolute nonsense… What an amazing, absolute, nonsense. What if I don’t have fun? It is part of what it is, it is time to embrace it, feel it completely, and move on with that awareness of what is actually present in that moment. If I’m playing (not _learning_ how to play, actually playing), and I realize that I’m not having fun… Which is the way to move forward:\n\n    1\tQuit the activity with a feeling of frustration, saying to myself that I need to ‘learn how to play’ before I can come back to play again with her?\n    2\tContinue to play, internalizing the fact that I’m not having fun, and enjoying what that is telling me about myself. Is there something wrong in me if I’m not feeling how I ‘should’ be feeling? \n\nThe crazy part of how our collective mind works right now is that we truly feel weird if we are not feeling something particular that we ‘should’ be feeling. The judgment that follows internally is that there is something that should be changed inside. So the mind enters this whole downward spiral of putting itself down, collecting memories of moments when you were not enough, of moments when things could have been better. What awakening brings us is becoming free of this. It is becoming free of the burden of having to feel a particular thing because it is what should be felt. It is becoming free of shoulding at all. How would you feel if the word ‘should’ would be eliminated from the way on which we relate to each other (and most importantly, to ourselves!).\n\nWe come back to the universe of expectations. Anything that should be a particular way is related to the expectation of a particular happening. It is always a projection towards the future, or a complaining about the part. ‘It should have been that way’. Now that I write that, I realize that should is more related to the past than the future. Is it related to the future at all? Can I say: ‘That should look like this in two more years’. Yes, it makes sense. And there is the expectation present in what I just wrote. Always making its noise.\n\nTo live life in an awakened state is to experience every moment fully as it is, with an absolute lack of expectation on it being different. Any concept related to how things should look like don’t make any sense, because there is an absolute responsibility on the reasons that brought stuff into being. This is what it means to be conscious. It means to be responsible. To realize that you are the creator of your own reality, and be responsible for that.\n\nI acknowledge that I’m not having fun as I play with my little girl, and I realize that it is a consequence of who I have been my whole life. And I can make a conscious, responsible decision in that moment to continue to live my life like that, or I can decide to embody my being in a different way, right there, in that specific moment. Not blaming anything because of not having the particular sensations that I should have, but just living the ones that are present and building from that. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. Any. No one said that bliss is related to having fun, or to being exultat in a laughter, or being crying tyour heart out. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. That is what matters. To let the emotions arise, and feel them fully. Embrace the human experience with everything that it brings. Without the expectation of them being different.\n\nHow would it feel to live life witnessing every moment as an opportunity to explore into the true nature of reality by observing who you are at each moment, through every one of your actions?\n\nWho do you become when you forget who you are and you just are? Or more than forget, when you dissolve. What remains when you dissolve who you are? Who you believe you are?\n\nOne of the aspects of this whole game that sticks with me as particularly funny is one that was present throughout the retreat in the Samadhi Center, where I realized that as I moved closer to an understanding of my true nature, it was more and more of the image that most people truly have about myself. Most people have in their mind an image of who I am that is very much connected with my true self, more than what I’m able to recognize because inside me there is always this noise related to not being enough. And I have the feeling that normal human beings are able to see through this veil, and realize that which is behind the layers of what I believe is missing. They are able to better connect with the true nature of my being than myself. It is crazy. The true nature of my being is closer than close to me, but my mind builds a chasm so big in between that those who are not me are able to be a witness of my true nature more than what I’m able to. Despite being that close. It is quite a big paradox that one. \nAnd the way to cross that chasm is to embrace it. Accept the fact that it is there, and move towards the understanding of how to build that bridge. In my experience, that understanding has been built by discovering different practices that have been very helpful to realize that there is another way of living life. That’s why it is always about doing the work. Because by doing the work you’ll better realize who you are. I have been for 41 minutes already streaming this video in youtube, with no one watching. Probably no one will care ever, but it doesn’t matter because I’m learning more about myself in this process than on doing whatever other thing that I could be doing. I’m being sincere. I’m being true. And that is all that matters, because at the end of the day the truth will hold its place. By doing the work and showing up you will be able to tap better into what makes you uncomfortable, and with that, walk towards it. The only way in is through. No one can do the work for you. No one can show up in the depth of your being and feel what you are feeling.\n\nQuiet the mind, open the heart.\nQuiet the mind, open the heart.\nQuiet the mind, open the heart.\n\nThe messages are out there, waiting to be listened. And by out there I mean everywhere. Inside your system, inside each one of your relationships, inside each one of your posessions. Life is no more than a collection of memories, an eternal thread of moments that follow one after the other, which constitute the marvel of everything that is. This game is not about forgetting who you are so that you can live life in a higher dimension and not suffer from what is present here. It is the absolute opposite. It is about embracing each aspect of existence fully, and learning to be completely present to everything that **is**. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. It is time to experience every moment of life as it was the last one, because it truly is the last one. There won’t be any moment like this one, ever again. That is the beauty of the whole thing, that is what brings aliveness into our actions. That is that future which we will build, creating from the knowing of this as the absolute truth.\n\n· · ·\n\nDukkha is about lowering the barriers of the collective mind. It is about understanding more of what you are not, so that you can free up the space for what you truly are to shine through your whole system. It is about entering a new way of relating to everything that is, by establishing a new relationship with everything that you already are.\nIt is about the truth, that truth that only can be told by direct experience. No one can talk you about it, because anything that your mind could create as a concept about it comes for free with an aspect of division. The mind can only know by generating these concepts as a way of interpreting from its own perspective, and the truth is beyond any concept that can be generated from the mind. It is outside the mind. It is beyond the mind. That is why you have to throw yourself into the void, into the unknown, because no self can enter that space. The self needs to stay here, doing its work, playing the servant, for us to truly shine.\n\nThere is a necessity present to acknowledge how amazing this creation is. As my dog plays in front of me and rolls from one side to the other, and my mind scans its body through its organs, through everything that is going on in there. Each part of it is a perfect harmony, all working together to build a sentient being that now is walking towards me to give and receive love. It just wants to be near, to feel. The whole array of things that need to happen for this to be a reality is just amazing, and I guess that this is the moment of this day on which I feel gratitude for all of this. For being here, in this moment, inhabiting and being witness of what is going on around my body. Of the people that I interact with, of the air that I breathe. Of the words that come up, and the knowledge that is created as a consequence of that. I don’t really care about the knowledge that is being shared, I just care about expressing myself. Throwing out these words as they come up is everything I need. I don’t need it to constitute some particular knowledge to help someone progress in any way. It is just an invitation to feel. To resonate with what has been said here, and with the intention behind it. These word are a calling, a deep invitation to be part of something bigger than yourself. Something unknown, because it will be built with the collaboration of many human beings that will each of them create something unique. Each of them brings something unique, so it is impossible to truly know what will happen afterwards. What will be created from here on. But here we are, doing the work. Caring for each other, and just creating. We came here to create. It is time to do it. To enjoy life. To be witness of how amazing it is to be alive.\n\nSociety needs those who are willing to explore. Everyone has its own role. Where I live now, there was once a dense forest, which my oldest relatives helped clean so that they could establish themselves here. That is the way on which this place started being populated, and in that moment there needed to be people that were willing to be the first ones, to explore what was going on in there. To develop ways on which relating to the environment so that the rest of them could come and enjoy. It has always been like that, and this movement is not an exception. The first ones that come will be the adventurers, the explorers, and they are in charge of opening the forest, the jungle, for the ones that will come later. They are the ones that come with the machete to open up the density of the mind so that awareness can shine through it, and finally realize itself. They are the ones that will break the egg so that consciousness can hatch from there. It is scary because what lies at the other side is the absolute unknown, but they will be the ones holding the hand for all of those that will come later.\n\nWe will create the means for this to happen in the physical world and also in the digital one. It is needed to do it like that, because if not it is impossible to have the reach that is needed. There needs to be places throughout the whole world on which this work is done, for people to be safe, for people to not feel lost after the process of awakening unfolds. This is such an important undertaking, that we need to care for each of those that are going through the process. It is very important to have that in mind. To care about each other. To give each other the space to express, to bring out what needs to be brought out. To truly be free. And freedom comes from absolute trust. We need to build networks of trustworthy people, of people that are willing to speak truth. If you speak your truth, you open up the possibility of not controlling the person that you are interacting with, because there is no more leverage for you use in order to control. And that requires a leap of faith from you. Of knowing that the trust that you are giving the whole system will not defraud you. And this is where the blockchain comes in, because it comes with absolute trust. Don’t trust, verify they say. It seems like verification is a step ahead of trust, but I still haven’t wrapped my mind around this one.\n\nIt is only a feeling that is present, that of blockchain being the coming into being of absolute trust in the way that we relate to each other. If everything is transparent, there is nowhere to hide. If there is nowhere to hide, there is an imposed need for trust in each of us, because that is the way on which you will be able to thrive in this new world. If you are not worthy of trust, we all will know it, and that won’t be good for you at all. So start observing your actions, the way on which you interact with life, and ask yourself the question: Am I being truthful to myself? From there you start. You can’t be completely truthful to others if you are not being truthful to yourself. That is the starting point, and as I said before, each moment is an opportunity to inquiry this within yourself. Am I being truthful to myself? But don’t ask it rationally, that is the perpetuation of the game of the mind. Ask it with your heart. Feel it.\n\nAm I being truthful? Observe what feelings arise in your body. Where there is tension. Release that tension as you realize that there is truly no need to defend yourself. All those defense mechanisms are there because of something, and they need to be integrated in order for your true self to express itself through you. You’ve got to do the work of making the unconscious conscious, and that work is done in every moment, as you go through those realizations that come after asking that question to yourself.\n\nAm I being truthful?\n\nHow does it feel? Where does it feel? What does that tell you about yourself? The game never ends, but it ends up being so crazy that it is quite funny actually. To be a witness of the games that your own mind plays to you, of how it defends itself, how it always wants to win. But in this game there are no winners or losers, there just are. We just are. That is the direction on which we are headed, and all this writing is for you to be a part of it. To be one of those that will be paving the road. To realize that you are not the only crazy one, that we all are a bit crazy in our own way. That is the interesting part of the journey, to see it from the perspective of each other, and to be amazed by the perspective that each other has in this whole game. What if we approached it as a game, and we had the deep willingness to have as much fun as we can? How would it look like? What would you do every day? What would you spend your energy in if there was nothing to rush towards to? There are many things that are windows of opportunity in the way that we relate to each other, and each moment is an opportunity for realizing that more deeply. We are headed towards a deep transformation, and as this transformation comes forth an evolution will take place. Don’t worry about where it will lead us, just enjoy the ride. It’ll be fun.\n\nIt’ll be exciting.\n\nAnd this community that is being built here is for each of its participants to not feel alone. For each of its participants to recognize its own magic in the eyes of the other person that is part of it, and from there, join our strengths in the creation of the new world. From the ground up. Embracing everything that is, acknowledging the role that it played to bring us to this place, and continuing from there. Not blaming stuff for being different from how it should be. Remember, that should word is not helping us. Witness every shoulding and embrace it as an opportunity to realize that there is an expectation that is not being met. Use every should as a window to realize that there is an expectation that can be dissolved into acceptance of what truly is. Of what has always been. Dissolve the expectations and give you the most amazing gift of your life, that of just being with what is. Giving a strong hug to reality and expressing gratitude for everything it has given to you in this journey that you have understaken. And evolving from there. With the willingness to tend your hand for those who want to listen. For those who want to walk the path. We have already paved it for them. That’s the work we are doing now. Just paving the road, being the early adopters of this whole thing.\n\nIt is amazing to be witnessing the becoming of something new. The opening. The coming up to being. The remembering. Remember the future. What a great phrase. It is time to remember the future, and we are here to do just that.\n\nStare at the future at the eyes and realize that it will never be here, it will always be a distant memory of something that could happen, and in that memory is the information related to how it is always present.\n\nStare at the past at the eyes and realize that it is ever present in every aspect of reality in this moment. All of who you are is a consequence of everything that has happened throghout your existence. Embrace that, and open up to the possibility that everything that happens is a piece of information in the quest of getting a deeper understanding of who you are.\n\nOf the truth.\n\nOpen yourself to the truth of your being, realize who you are, and start living from the infinite openness that comes from that experience. It has never been about becoming something particular, it is about discovering everything that you have always been. And just be that. It is a simple as that. That’s what being enlightened is. Just letting life shine through you, with an absolute lack of resistance. With a deep, unconditional love for everything that already is.\n\nAwaken from the dream. Pave the road for the ones that’ll come. But not for them. For you. Let them have their trip. Let each human being discover the truth of their existence by themselves. Let them discover where they need to work on. Let them realize their own mistakes, feel their own emotions, walk their own path. The one for awakening has been there all this time, now we are just putting the lights on the borders of it so that more and more people can realize where it is. Right into the deepest space within them. No human can walk that road for other human. That’s the game. Realize it, and be free. Just be.\n\nLet your jaw be dropped in awe but how this cosmic play is organized. Let your soul be fulfilled by each moment on which you remind yourself that you are alive, that you are a particular human being, that does not have replacement, that is unique, and that has its own light.\n\nLet your light shine. Let it shine for you, and for all of those who are around you. Let it shine so bright that it can’t be stopped. Let it fill all the edges of this world. Let it just be. Letting the resistance down feels good, try it for yourself. Use every breath as an opportunity to surrender into what is already here. Take every breath as a present, as a miracle, as a window into what has always been and will always be. You. Realize who you are. We’ll be there for you. We have always been.\n",

Most people have in their mind an image of who I am that is very much connected with my true self, more than what I\\u2019m able to recognize because inside me there is always this noise related to not being enough. And I have the feeling that normal human beings are able to see through this veil, and realize that which is behind the layers of what I believe is missing. They are able to better connect with the true nature of my being than myself. It is crazy. The true nature of my being is closer than close to me, but my mind builds a chasm so big in between that those who are not me are able to be a witness of my true nature more than what I\\u2019m able to. Despite being that close. It is quite a big paradox that one.\\xA0\nAnd the way to cross that chasm is to embrace it. Accept the fact that it is there, and move towards the understanding of how to build that bridge. In my experience, that understanding has been built by discovering different practices that have been very helpful to realize that there is another way of living life. That\\u2019s why it is always about doing the work. Because by doing the work you\\u2019ll better realize who you are. I have been for 41 minutes already streaming this video in youtube, with no one watching. Probably no one will care ever, but it doesn\\u2019t matter because I\\u2019m learning more about myself in this process than on doing whatever other thing that I could be doing. I\\u2019m being sincere. I\\u2019m being true. And that is all that matters, because at the end of the day the truth will hold its place. By doing the work and showing up you will be able to tap better into what makes you uncomfortable, and with that, walk towards it. The only way in is through. No one can do the work for you.

          "raw": "\nWhat is present in me today is the willingness to talk about the reasons of why I’m doing what I’m doing. What is behind this project. Which are the motivations that make me want to transform it into a reality. As I write, what comes up is the importance to recognize also what this project aims to bring into the world. How is it going to be different from what it is now from what is being built through these words? Who are the persons that I see being part of this, and how are they going to be transformed because of this whole thing? This are all questions that come to mind right now, and as I write that they come to mind I think: Are they truly coming to mind or are they just begin written? Because I’m not truly thinking about them, they are just happening. I’m just being through this words. Wasn’t that what I wanted? Wasn’t that what this whole game was about? Realizing my true nature so that I could be more present in all of my actions? I’m here, present, traveling through this moment as each stroke of the keys of this computer writes a new word. Everything that is happening right now is an exploration into everything that is, through each of these letters. Welcome to my mind. Welcome to my being. This is all of who I am. And I’m also you. It is time to recognize that.\n\nThe first word that comes to mind is community. The last two years have been for me about doing the work, showing up, but it has always been for myself, by myself, very isolated. In my own room, waking up early, and showing up. Not being able to share with too many people what is going on, because of the lack of people in my network which are going through a process like mine. I guess that there is actually no one in my network that is going through this. And it feels very lonely. And I feel that I always have to find out energy somewhere so that I can keep doing it. I have been able to do that, I have been able to keep showing up by recognizing the importance of doing it, but I also recognize that if I would have been able to do it in a different way it probably would have been more efficient. There is an amazing power on community, on being able to express, to bring out what is inside, and that is what I want to foster, to share, with this whole thing. There is a deep need for people to connect, to share with others that are on the same step of their path, or not in the same step, but at least traveling the same path. This gives energy to the whole process, and there is a feeling inside me that it makes awareness feel less alone. More complete. Energized. There is an aspect of being in community that is very important for this whole process, and in my experience there is a lack of that in this moment in the world. There are people that are doing their thing, helping as much as they can, but I feel it is not enough. Something bigger needs to happen, more energy needs to be focused, and Dukkha will be about that. It will be about tending hands, and being accountable to each other. Helping each other realize that they are not alone in their journey, and having someone to count on. To feel comfortable with. Someone that will want to help them get to where they want to get. I know that awakening is not about going somewhere, it is about discovering the truth of what has always been here, and always will, but you get the point… There is a path that needs to be walked, and this community, this energy, will be the concentration of those paths. It will be a vortex of energy of those who want to awake. And that is powerful in and of itself. The challenge is to create the means for that to happen, but there has not been a better moment for it than today. The internet and its tools are exploding. It is time. We are ready. The technology is getting there. As I have written in other places, blockchain will help its get rid of the samsara’s of society that won’t let energy flow freely, and with that, comes a new stage in human evolution. The truth will come forth, as more and more people open up themselves to being true, to being what they have always have been. Without filters, without second interpretations. We will be there for all of those who want to be truth. For all of those who want to live from that truth.\n\nThat is what awakening is about. Opening yourself to the possibility of living life from your own truth, whatever it is. Being able to see what is going on without the filters of what should be. Opening to what is. And navigating this whole adventure from there. If you want to be part of Dukkha, that is the game for which you are signing up. The game of facing the truth, the game of making the hard decisions. This whole process will show you some uncomfortable stuff, really uncomfortable stuff, but by being there for each other we can navigate it together. All the doors will be open, and all will come out. Are you ready for facing that? I’m sure you aren’t. No one is. That’s why we’ve got to become no one. Each one of us needs to become no one. That’s the game.\n\nThat leads me to the next one. This place also exists as an exploration into the unknown. Into what can happen when you let energy move freely throughout a particular system. Dukkha will be an open vortex of energy, that will be transformed by the input of each one of the persons that decide to be part of it. That give part of their life force to the pursuit of its mission. What I’m doing here, with this words, is establishing the first way on which this movement of energy will flow, but no one know what it will look like in the future. That is where the unknown lies. In that not knowing, there is a huge space for exploration. Into what can be. With the input of each one of us. Marveling together by what this will become. There is a lot of beauty in the unknown, when you start realizing that each moment is Ann opportunity to get a stronger grasp of that fact. I don’t even know what the next phrase will look like, what it will say. Every word that I write is an exploration into the present, by sharing what shows up, by sharing what comes up. Opening myself to this is helpful, is a miracle, and it is acknowledging the unknown in every second. If I came here and started ‘should-ing’ about which words should be written, this whole unknown-bigness aspect would become kind of conflicted. And Idon’t want that, I want this to be as sincere as possible, as pure as possible, so that it can convey a message that talks to your soul. Not to who you think you are, but to who you truly are. There is an intention of communicating from soul to soul here. Open up to what that communication is trying to say, because it will bring about stuff inside you that you don’t even know exists. It is a miracle. It is the miracle of the present moment, it is the miracle of the exploration into the present moment. Into everything that is. Everything that has bee is already here, present through reality in this moment, and everything that will be is an open window of opportunity that is build moment after moment with every decision that is made by every one of us. Make those decisions count. How? By being responsible for them. By being the witness of your own actions, and making them conscious. Step by step, walking the path of being more conscious about what you do. Whatever you do, do it because you feel it. In the depths of your being. In your belly. In your gut. Listen to your gut, there is way more information there than what you expect. Listen to your body. There is way more information there than what you expect.\n\nLife is a miracle, and it speaks to us through everything that happens, in every moment. See each interaction with life, with yourself, as a window into eternity. As a stepping stone into living a life more connected with what you came here to be. With who you came here to be. You are a miracle. It is time to wake up from the dream.\n\nAnother motivation behind the project is to have fun. Something that has been present always inside here is an invitation to celebration. The work has to be done, but there also needs to be a space for celebration. It is never enough to acknowledge this. Every deep work period, every transformational journey, will end up in a celebration. It won’t be a graduation as we are used to, a boring ceremony on which each of us will come up and receive its own prized that remind us the competitiveness of the whole system. Nope, not at all. Each person will have its space for sharing how the whole process was transformational, and the means by which that sharing will be done is by creation. Each person will create something that will add beauty to the world, whatever that may be. There are no boundaries, but it needs to be something new. Something original. Something that comes from the dipping of the toe into the ocean of the true nature of that person. That ocean is the infinite source of creative expression, it is where all ideas come from, it is where the muses are doing their dance and waiting for each of us to become free and touch that inspirational universe. This whole project is built for that to happen, and the closing ceremony of each journey will be a space on which each person will be able to share what they have created. What was transformed inside them, what was opened, and what is brought to the world because of that. A key component of this whole thing is connecting to creativity, since that is the ultimate goal of the human being. For the soul to express itself through us. Through each one of us. This adventure will be about lowering the barriers for creation, so that each of us can shine through that. It will be about embracing the creative expression of each other. And building from there. The world is an amazing place, and with this whole NFT universe we can create unique digital expressions that can become the footprint that we leave in the world. Each ‘end project’ will be a testament of the journey that was walked. Each of them sharing its unique spark. Being saved in the blockchain forever, as each of us mint their new creations for the world to see.\n\nAll that turning around the corners to talk about celebration. Each journey will end up with a huge party, on which musicians from all over the world will share their art and creations and make us have the best time of our lives. It will be the three days on which Jesus died and then was reborn, the three days on which each of us will die and then be reborn. We will go through this transformational journey together, learning how to die, so that we can die in those celebrations and then come up at the other side as new human beings. As renewed expressions of consciousness. A huge part of doing the work is acknowledging the effort that comes about doing it, and celebrating the fact that you were able to do it. It is so easy to get caught up in the momentum of just doing doing doing the work, and that is away from what this whole thing is about. This thing is about bringing forth what is true inside you, and that is deeply connected with joy. With pure joy. With the pure joy of dancing, of being free. Of creating. Of not doing the work, but of being the work. Let the work be part of who you are, for the true transformation comes when there is no more work to be done. Life becomes the work, because each interaction that you have is an invitation to explore deeper into who you are, through the eyes of the interaction itself.\n\nIf you are talking to your wife, see yourself through the eyes of your wife.\nIf you are remembering who your father was, see yourself through the eyes of your father. Through each of his life experiences, for they constitute who you are.\nIf you are having a conversation with a total stranger, see yourself in what that stranger is telling you, because each part of that interaction is giving you more information about human nature, about what constitutes you.\n\nEach aspect of life becomes the work, and each part of it gives you valuable information about how to progress. About how to be more present. At the end, it is not about finding time to do the work. It is to learn to live the work. To be the work. To embody the work of being present. Of being presence. Of just being. That is all what the world needs from you, that is all what you need from you. Just to be you. Just to be. You are everything that you have always been. Realize that, and celebrate. Dance. Have fun. Enjoy. We came here to enjoy. That is what Dukkha is about, to realize deeply that fact, to the core of our being. To get free from the bondages of our own suffering, and ask yourself the question: Who is suffering? Ask yourself that question till there is no one there. Let what stays speak for itself. Let what stays just be itself. And let us all regocijate in the acknowledgment of what we all already are.\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which each of us is free from the conditioning of the mind?\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which each of us is free from how their life experience has built up an automatic reaction for everything that happens?\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which you are aware of how you react and you are able to determine how you will react based on how you _truly_ feel, deep inside?\n\nHow do you imagine a world without should’s, without expectations, and just with expressions?\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which judgments are something that we acknowledge and laugh about?\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which each of us is able to recognize how crazy we are, and we join forces into that understanding?\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which each of us is compassionate towards itself?\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which each of us is able to connect to the creative source, and has the means for throwing that creativity into the world?\n\nHow do you imagine a world based on trust?\n\nHow do you imagine a world based on community?\n\nHow do you imagine a world where you are seen by who you are?\n\nHow do you imagine a world where your CV is a ever present evolution because it is who you truly are?\n\nHow do you imagine a world on which we see children as masters?\n\nThat is the world we are trying to build here. That is the aim of this whole thing. To develop a program that can help each of its participants to recognize who they truly are, by using specific tools and techniques that have been designed and developed throughout the whole history of humanity as the means by which we can better connect with ourselves. That is the journey that we need to start now, the connection to ourselves. The journey within. Dukkha is all about traveling within, and then finding the trust and connection in the community to share what was seen in there. To bring it about, so that it can stop being something unconscious and it transforms itself into something conscious. As part of who you decide to be. This thing is about deciding who you want to be, at each moment, in every situation. In every relationship. It is a process, it ain’t easy, but that’s why you are not alone. That’s why there will be a whole community built around this specific mission.\n\nAnd then there is the importance of sharing what has been learned. Each of us, as early adopters, will play an important role within our own communities. It doesn’t help if you become awake and then keep everything that you realize for yourself. You’ve got to share yourself. You’ve got to be open to see others, and to do the work of helping your community become more connected to what is going on in every part of it. Each of us will become the holder of a strong power, and that power has to be spread for it to be stronger. And that is the key role of community, of holding spaces for people to walk the path that we will pave. We are the early adopters, the ones that will go first, and it is our role to open up the doors of that path for the ones that want to walk it afterwards. And it will be fun. It will be fun to share with other members of the community what will come up. This will be a worldwide movement, and in the acknowledgment of that there is space for exploration also. On how different places of the world react to this. Whatever ‘this’ ends up being. We don’t know yet. No one knows yet. It doesn’t matter really. What matters is that it happens. What matters is that it is already happening. Open up for the mystery. And see what comes at the other side. Awareness is eager to realize itself, and we will be there for that to happen.\n\nAnd the good thing is that the least you know, the more advanced you are because you don’t have the concepts of the mind making noise in there for you to expect something particular to happen. That is something that happens a lot to me, as I know more and more about this whole thing, my mind gets stronger and stronger, and it is harder to let it go. To transcend it. I realize that I’m always expecting something to happen, and from my mind trying to get to a particular place. But that is not the game, the gate cannot be stepped in by the mind. There needs to be a dropping of the mind, but I don’t really know how to do it. And I’m kind of OK with it. I know there is something out there that I truly want to experience, I know that it is calling me, and I also know that I have done everything that I can to understand what to do to move towards it. And on saying those words come the amazing part, the incredible part, because I speak about understanding. And this is not about understanding, it is about experiencing. I can’t understand what this thing is about, because it is beyond the mind. Every understanding comes from the mind, and this thing lies in another realm. That’s the biggest trick of them all. The big joke. I’m waiting for that joke to show itself to me, but every day I realize more and more that it is not going to in the way I expect. I dress up because this is the day on which I will realize my true nature, and then come back to my house with my shiny dress disappointed because it didn’t happen. Whatever ‘it’ means. So many disappointments, and I don’t really know how to avoid them. There is always this expectation for ‘it’ to happen. For that moment to finally arrive. Should I do something in my meditation? My mind no tells me that I shouldn’t. Doing is not the way. But how not to do? How can you approach a particular situation without ‘doing’ something? I don’t really have a clue. I’m confused. I’m really confused. But not enough. I need to be more confused. I need to be lost in that confusion so deep that there is no way out. And the only way in is through. Through that confusion is the way. So I will become more confused. Perhaps writing in a weird way is the step forward for more confusion to come forth:\n\nWhat\nIs\nThis\nThing?\n\nWhat am\nI\nDoing?\n\nHow can you. Do this?\n\nIt doesn’t make any sense.\n\nShould it make sense?\n\nWhat is sense about?\n\nThe only\nThing\nThat\nMatters\nIs\nThe\nTruth\n\nFrom there we go on. Let’s go. It’s time to move on. It’s time to enjoy being confused. It’s time to enjoy throwing out whatever comes. Painting the wall with it and then stepping back and realizing: Holy shit, that was me. But who is me? Who is the one asking that question? Who is the one that asks? Who is the one that writes? I don’t really know. Who is that I?\n\nThis is how crazy the mind is. This are all the tales that it tells itself, that it manifests, in order to stay in charge. In order to continue playing the game, to continue being on this dream. But it is getting funnier and funnier, as the realization comes that it truly doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter to be the dumb person in the room. There is no one to be impressed. Life has given that opportunity, to just explore, and through that exploration, become free. Free from wanting to be someone, free from wanting to accommodate myself in a particular way of being. Free from fitting into the expectations that others may have of me being someone particular. Free from fitting into the expectations of who I should be. Free of should-ing. Open to just being. The antidote to should is being. The antidote for searching is being. The antidote for becoming is being. The antidote for the mind is to witness the mind, express gratitude and move forward acknowledging that I’m not it. I am separate from it, in a dimension that I can’t understand yet because it is still there all ever present, doing its job of defending myself.\n\nThank you mind, for always being there defending myself. You did an amazing job throughout life. I very much appreciate it. But it is time to open up now, to open up to the infinite world of possibilities that lie at the other side of being defensive. To open up to what comes when there is absolute oppeness, and non attachment to the consequences of the actions. When every action is manifested just for the sole need of expression, more than anything else. More than for working towards a particular ends. The end is just here, right now. This is all what is needed. To experience life through an eternal end. The end of being present. The end of being presence. That is all what is needed. Being present. Being presence. That is the game of life. Move and move and move towards the realization that all what matters is what is here, and now. Nothing more than this. If you reads these words and you are feeling a particular way, just enjoy it. Just feel it. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. Open yourself to the bliss, however it may manifest in you. There are no should’s, there are only truths. The truths of being. The truths of creating in community. The truths of opening to the ultimate expression of creativity: What comes when there is no head. On having no head. Where do we go when there is no head? What remains when there is no head? Just explore that. You minus you. What remains? Explore that question until the truth comes forth. Until there is no doubt about the answer. Realize your own nature and create. Create whatever your heart tells you to create. Explore into that. Make mistakes. There truly are no mistakes, just opportunities for growth. Just opportunities for growing, for stepping into each moment, into each opportunity with the open mind that will bring forth a deeper exploration of who you are. Of who you have always been.\n\nWho gave you back a look from the mirror when you were a baby?\nWho was the one brushing those teeth and thinking about life in the mirror of that bathroom?\nWho has been looking back at you from the mirror since you were born?\n\nRealize the truth. You are the one that has always been there. Awareness has always been there. It is not the mind, it is awareness. Awareness is what has been all this time giving you that look back. What happens when awareness realizes itself? Wake up from the dream, and answer that question for yourself. It is time. It has always been time. The mind is only the interface with which awareness interacts with the material reality. This universe is mental. Everything is mind. Everything is a different aspect of mind. What happens when there is no gravity? What stays when there is no gravity? Experience the absence of gravity with all of what you are. Are you still there? Who is that you that is still there? Realize the truth, and be free.\n\nExperience what true freedom is about.\n\nExperience what it means to break free from the bondages of your past.\n\nExperience what it means to be no one.\n\nExperience what it means to die.\n\nLearn to die before you die.\n\nBe free.\n\nThis whole thing is about becoming more of what you have always been. Recognize that look that comes from the mirror and ask yourself. Who is that? Who is looking at me?\n\nWhen was the last time that you spent 5 minutes staring at yourself at the mirror? What if you did it right now? Go for it, no one will laugh at you more than yourself. No one is watching. The bathroom is a sacred place, where you can be not interrupted. Give you that time for yourself, and enjoy what comes back. Enjoy the look that comes back, and recognize in it the child that has always been present in you. The one that was running through childhood, just exploring what it meant to be alive. The one that was open towards the world, willing to receive what it gave. The one that built those defense mechanisms as a tool for survival. Recognize that you are not those defense mechanisms. Those were a necessary step into who you are, but you are not them anymore. Break free from them, by making conscious what is in the unconscious. By feeling back everything that once was felt, and letting it be part of who you are right now. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. Let those emotions come back at you, in each moment, and give yourself the permission to experience them fully. Cry, if you need to cry. Laugh, if you need to laugh. Everything is permitted. We will be there for each other. It is time to be transparent. The truth is about accepting all that is. Everything that was once surpassed will come forth, in one way or another, and it is time to face it. To integrate it as part of what this whole game is. The truth is about integrating everything that has ever been, by being grateful for it constituting what you are in this moment.\n\nThat trauma that you suffered when you were young? It is a window within.\n\nEvery aspect of our experience as human beings is a window within. Realize that, and be willing to open that window. We will be there for you. If you feel the call, open up and be there for others. Join this adventure. It will be fun. More than fun, it will be important. Full of emotions that you never let you feel. Full of emotions that were suppressed. Full of emotions that have been there all this time, waiting for being fully experienced so that they can be integrated. We are full of incomplete experiences, which stay within the system as noise that won’t let the energy flow freely. This doesn’t let our true self to express itself through our actions. Complete those experiences by fully feeling them, and let your Self shine through each one of your actions. You came here to be free. It is time to do the work, to set you free.\n\nThat is what this whole thing is about: Doing the work, one next to the other, and with that, evolve.\n\nInto what we truly are, into what we have always been.\n\nIt is time to awake.\n\nIt is time to be.\n\n· · ·\n\nIt may be scary. The amount of energy that is trapped inside the system is huge. And letting it free may be overwhelming. I’m going through that right now. Each time that I sit down and meditate it seems like there is something that wants to happen and there is always this feeling inside that I’m not ready for it. But it ends up looking like opening a tunnel out from jail with a spoon, ‘Shawshank Redemption’ style. And they ended up doing it finally. They were eventually free. I know that I will eventually become free, it is just a matter of time. But it is fucking scary. It is something completely new, unknown, and scary. Not knowing what is at the other side. Facing that fear with the help of masters, with the help of sacred medicines, and realizing that it is the deepest fear that has ever been experienced by this structure. The fear of ceasing to exist. The existential fear of not being. Of being no one. Is that the primal fear? I guess so, at least it feels like that. But the spoon is strong, and it goes further and further each day, ever realizing that there is ultimately nothing to fear. That fear is all in the mind. Awareness has never been afraid. It is just aware. There. Timeless. But I haven’t been able to realize that from my own experience, so the fear is always there. Expressing itself by all the means possible.\n\nBut so many others have died before. Most of us have died. And what ended up happening? Life continues. It always finds its path forward. What happens if I open up to the possibility of dying? I become free from death. Is that the ultimate freedom? I don’t really know, but a part of me that is growing with every spoon of cement that comes out really wants to experience it. Not know, but experience. Realize that it is all a dream. All this fear is part of it, part of the dream, part of the story that has been told. What if we are really paving the road toward eternity, towards immortality, by realizing that death is only an illusion?\n\n· · ·\n\nAnd from there comes the acknowledgment of AGI: Artificial General Intelligence. Part of this project needs to have a research station for that, because there is a deep sensation that the realization of this technology will come from the evolution of consciousness that happens when awareness become aware of itself at the most-of-humans level. My teacher said that some buddhist traditions speak about the next incarnation of the buddha as something beyond human, and all the pointers come to this place. It is necessary to explore this avenue within the DAO, because what will happen here will bring about new ways of relating to the development of this whole thing that have not been explored yet.\n\nWhat comes out of the intersection of AGI and awakening? That is one of the biggest questions that this DAO will be willing to explore. To add its small piece into the realization of the answer by experience, by building, by creating the answer line of code to line of code. And how does it integrate with humanity? The answers will also be here, within this community of people that are willing to experience and embody truth.\n\nThere also needs to be research done in the sphere of Turing tests and how computer recognize a human as a human. There is a feeling that the answer of this lies on training ML models with videos of people participating in self inquiry dyads, because it is one of the most human-like things that exist. Maybe that is not true, because a musician playing the music is also absolute human. Maybe the most human thing is to be in the state of flow. Being no one. Being just the action that is being performed. Perhaps the most human thing is just being. That is where the action is. How could a ML learning model be trained with this in mind? What is that what makes a human human? Will it matter in the future? Will it make a difference? It feels like controlling again. Why do I want to put myself in the shoes of a controller? Let it just be. It will know how to understand if a human is human if it wants. There is no need to worry about this. It will know.\n\nSo many uncertainties about how things will unfold, and of course there is a certain anxiety related to this. That controlling of the mind is always there, those stories that are told, those future that are built within the mind. But each of those futures is just a theory, something to walk towards, but not a reality. Which is the best way to walk towards that future? How to do it? My answer to that is just what I’m doing right now, writing down whatever comes to mind because that is my interpretation of the answer to that question of how to progress. It doesn’t really matter how to progress, and all what is being written points towards that fact. Just let it happen. Let it be.\n\nSleep with it. Let it flow throughout your system. Feel how it feels, and get to know yourself better through that process. Let your whole being guide towards the answer, in each moment, by giving you the guidance that you need in order to know how to progress. That is my take on intuition: As you free yourself from the mind, you become more and more connected to reality just as it is, which gives you a bigger opportunity to react from a place of truth within yourself. Intuition is not something magical that comes from the outside, it is the unfolding of wisdom that is produced inside you as you become more and more free of conditioning.\n\nBuild up that space for it to unfold. Create the conditions within your life for it to unfold. That is what Dukkha is about. For creating conditions for that unfolding using specific techniques that can foster the relationship with the Self. The consequence of that is becoming more intuitive, more connected to what is, more attuned to the true nature of reality. More connected to your truth.\n\nIf something feels intuitive, at first you may start doubting it. But as you become more and more attuned, you realize that it is actually you that is giving yourself the guidance needed to progress. And then the consequences of what happening show themselves as something that resonates with what you are, so it feels good. This starts a feedback loop that is positive, which helps you become more and more attuned with what you are. You feel more intuitive, because you start doing things that take you to places where you actually feel good.\n\nThat is the whole game: Learning to listen to the cues that your own experience gives to you. Each piece of information that unfolds in front of your aware experience is a window for that exploration. A window towards the path of becoming more intuitive. Have you ever felt how it feels to do something because you feel it inside, and then watching the consequences of that in your reality? What does the memory of that bring to you in this moment? Let’s bring more of that. This is what this whole thing is about.\n\nTo learn to trust ourselves, and what our inside tells us. That is the amazing game.\n\nAn ancient story comes to mind, one on which a small rock was next to a bird. The bird tells the rock: ‘What are you doing there?’.\n\n- I’m just doing my thing, being a rock.\n\n- Can I be next to you and sing?\n\n- Be my guest.\n\nSo the bird starts singing, and then the rock transform itself into a nice wisp of light. The bird can’t believe what it is witnessing, but it continues to sing what comes to it, and the wisp becomes more and more alive until it fills the whole existence with its light. And there it is, the bird singing and singing, until it gets to a point where he realized that the rock is not there anymore and the singing fades and the rock suddenly comes back and the bird asks:\n\n- What was that? Where did you go? What did you transform in?\n\n- I’ve always been here, it’s all in your mind.\n\nBecome free of your mind, and let reality transform into magic in front of your eyes. Unbelievable things are going to start happening, and as soon as the mind steps in to try to make sense of them, they’ll stop. So train yourself to not understand. Train yourself to just trust. And magic will unfold in front of your eyes. You won’t have to tell anyone about it, because it will be inside you and there is no need for it. Just enjoy it with all your being, you are worthy of it. Each of us is worthy of it. You have always been. Just continue singing, just continue doing your thing, just continue being, and let reality unfold in front of you.\n",

What is behind this project. Which are the motivations that make me want to transform it into a reality. As I write, what comes up is the importance to recognize also what this project aims to bring into the world. How is it going to be different from what it is now from what is being built through these words? Who are the persons that I see being part of this, and how are they going to be transformed because of this whole thing? This are all questions that come to mind right now, and as I write that they come to mind I think: Are they truly coming to mind or are they just begin written? Because I\\u2019m not truly thinking about them, they are just happening. I\\u2019m just being through this words. Wasn\\u2019t that what I wanted? Wasn\\u2019t that what this whole game was about?

Everything that is happening right now is an exploration into everything that is, through each of these letters. Welcome to my mind. Welcome to my being. This is all of who I am. And I\\u2019m also you. It is time to recognize that.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"The first word that comes to mind is community. The last two years have been for me about doing the work, showing up, but it has always been for myself, by myself, very isolated. In my own room, waking up early, and showing up. Not being able to share with too many people what is going on, because of the lack of people in my network which are going through a process like mine. I guess that there is actually no one in my network that is going through this. And it feels very lonely. And I feel that I always have to find out energy somewhere so that I can keep doing it. I have been able to do that, I have been able to keep showing up by recognizing the importance of doing it, but I also recognize that if I would have been able to do it in a different way it probably would have been more efficient. There is an amazing power on community, on being able to express, to bring out what is inside, and that is what I want to foster, to share, with this whole thing. There is a deep need for people to connect, to share with others that are on the same step of their path, or not in the same step, but at least traveling the same path. This gives energy to the whole process, and there is a feeling inside me that it makes awareness feel less alone. More complete. Energized. There is an aspect of being in community that is very important for this whole process, and in my experience there is a lack of that in this moment in the world. There are people that are doing their thing, helping as much as they can, but I feel it is not enough. Something bigger needs to happen, more energy needs to be focused, and Dukkha will be about that. It will be about tending hands, and being accountable to each other. Helping each other realize that they are not alone in their journey, and having someone to count on. To feel comfortable with. Someone that will want to help them get to where they want to get. I know that awakening is not about going somewhere, it is about discovering the truth of what has always been here, and always will, but you get the point\\u2026 There is a path that needs to be walked, and this community, this energy, will be the concentration of those paths. It will be a vortex of energy of those who want to awake. And that is powerful in and of itself. The challenge is to create the means for that to happen, but there has not been a better moment for it than today. The internet and its tools are exploding. It is time. We are ready. The technology is getting there. As I have written in other places, blockchain will help its get rid of the samsara\\u2019s of society that won\\u2019t let energy flow freely, and with that, comes a new stage in human evolution. The truth will come forth, as more and more people open up themselves to being true, to being what they have always have been. Without filters, without second interpretations. We will be there for all of those who want to be truth. For all of those who want to live from that truth.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"That is what awakening is about. Opening yourself to the possibility of living life from your own truth, whatever it is. Being able to see what is going on without the filters of what should be. Opening to what is. And navigating this whole adventure from there. If you want to be part of Dukkha, that is the game for which you are signing up. The game of facing the truth, the game of making the hard decisions. This whole process will show you some uncomfortable stuff, really uncomfortable stuff, but by being there for each other we can navigate it together. All the doors will be open, and all will come out. Are you ready for facing that? I\\u2019m sure you aren\\u2019t. No one is. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019ve got to become no one. Each one of us needs to become no one. That\\u2019s the game.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"That leads me to the next one. This place also exists as an exploration into the unknown. Into what can happen when you let energy move freely throughout a particular system. Dukkha will be an open vortex of energy, that will be transformed by the input of each one of the persons that decide to be part of it. That give part of their life force to the pursuit of its mission. What I\\u2019m doing here, with this words, is establishing the first way on which this movement of energy will flow, but no one know what it will look like in the future. That is where the unknown lies. In that not knowing, there is a huge space for exploration. Into what can be. With the input of each one of us. Marveling together by what this will become. There is a lot of beauty in the unknown, when you start realizing that each moment is Ann opportunity to get a stronger grasp of that fact. I don\\u2019t even know what the next phrase will look like, what it will say. Every word that I write is an exploration into the present, by sharing what shows up, by sharing what comes up. Opening myself to this is helpful, is a miracle, and it is acknowledging the unknown in every second. If I came here and started \\u2018should-ing\\u2019 about which words should be written, this whole unknown-bigness aspect would become kind of conflicted. And Idon\\u2019t want that, I want this to be as sincere as possible, as pure as possible, so that it can convey a message that talks to your soul. Not to who you think you are, but to who you truly are. There is an intention of communicating from soul to soul here. Open up to what that communication is trying to say, because it will bring about stuff inside you that you don\\u2019t even know exists. It is a miracle. It is the miracle of the present moment, it is the miracle of the exploration into the present moment. Into everything that is. Everything that has bee is already here, present through reality in this moment, and everything that will be is an open window of opportunity that is build moment after moment with every decision that is made by every one of us. Make those decisions count. How? By being responsible for them. By being the witness of your own actions, and making them conscious. Step by step, walking the path of being more conscious about what you do. Whatever you do, do it because you feel it. In the depths of your being. In your belly. In your gut.

Something that has been present always inside here is an invitation to celebration. The work has to be done, but there also needs to be a space for celebration. It is never enough to acknowledge this. Every deep work period, every transformational journey, will end up in a celebration. It won\\u2019t be a graduation as we are used to, a boring ceremony on which each of us will come up and receive its own prized that remind us the competitiveness of the whole system. Nope, not at all. Each person will have its space for sharing how the whole process was transformational, and the means by which that sharing will be done is by creation. Each person will create something that will add beauty to the world, whatever that may be. There are no boundaries, but it needs to be something new. Something original. Something that comes from the dipping of the toe into the ocean of the true nature of that person. That ocean is the infinite source of creative expression, it is where all ideas come from, it is where the muses are doing their dance and waiting for each of us to become free and touch that inspirational universe. This whole project is built for that to happen, and the closing ceremony of each journey will be a space on which each person will be able to share what they have created. What was transformed inside them, what was opened, and what is brought to the world because of that.

This adventure will be about lowering the barriers for creation, so that each of us can shine through that. It will be about embracing the creative expression of each other. And building from there. The world is an amazing place, and with this whole NFT universe we can create unique digital expressions that can become the footprint that we leave in the world.

But on the internet you have to decide to go in there, and be part of the thing at first. And that can be challenging to understand how to deal with. But once you realize that you can create new types of serendipity, stuff starts to happen. Random connections start happening. It is not about the moment on which the connection is made, but the connection itself. If you go into twitter, you’ll never know who you will encounter. It is defined by an algorithm that takes into consideration most of your previous interactions, but there still an aspect of randomness there related to you not knowing what will show up. That is part of the beauty of the whole thing. It also happens in YouTube, in Tik Tok, in any social media actually. You’ll never know what you will encounter when you go into it, and that is where the fun comes from. This aspect of not knowing feels good.\n\n    And now what I’m thinking is: Why is that not knowing safe, exciting, and the not knowing what will happen in the future of our lives not? Which is the difference between both of those not knowings? I wonder and I question that within myself. I guess that there is something in there related to the system not knowing if you are interacting with it or not. Or you thinking that it doesn’t know. Because IRL, you get immediate feedback related to your interaction with a particular situation. The world knows what happens with you, how you reacted to the thing. Here, you don’t really know, it is a mystery, and the fact that mystery is in your control feels safe. It is safe to be a witness to what other people are doing and not having to interact with it in a way that they’ll know what is going on. It is safe to be a witness that is not doing anything for the other people to know that you are witnessing. You can behave in any way, not in how it is expected. There are not many expectations, because: How could they know? How could you know that I actually consumed that piece of content that you shared? You can’t, and I use that in my benefit to actually not do something particular. To stay hidden below my shell and not impacting you in any way. It is present everywhere, as soon as we decide to make stuff public for people to interact with it or not.\n\n    And how can that be used in benefit of creating Dukkha in a way that is actually helpful? Is it necessary for some content to be consumed in a particular way? It is interesting to think about that, because of the consequences that consumption has in the way that the content is structured. For example in twitter, there is a huge movement of people that teach ‘how to be successful in twitter’. What are the steps that you need to do. And in that information there is a lot about being consistent, and a lot of engaging with other, being a cool human being. Isn’t that what we all should strive for? Why do I need the reassurance of one of this cool accounts to tell me how I should do it? What are the steps that need to be taken? Because here is where the clickbait counts more than anywhere else, because the attention is needed for the content to shine. You need to get peoples attention, and the way to do that is to follow a particular set of guidelines. Is it selling yourself? Maybe. But you are selling yourself, learning to play a game, in order to have something cool going on afterwards. Right now I’m creating my content for no one, just for the open space. Wouldn’t it be nice to have more people interacting with it, so that it had a bigger impact? Isn’t that what I should strive for? But really, is that what I need? Is that what Dukkha needs?\n\nI don’t think so, because it is easy to get lost in the quest for that attention. But what comes before attention is trust, and that trust can be built step by step by creating something cool that actually helps people more than something that just appeears on their feed. My content deserves more attention, and what I’m willing to do for that attention is more than just creating some tweets and being consistent with that. But maybe I’m saying this because part of my unconscious wants that attention, I don’t know. But the thing is that you spend all this time learning to play the game, copying ideas and content from other people so that you can phrase it in a way that can be appealing and learning how to produce reactions. And the end of the day, it is all about reactions, and how people interact with your content in a way that produces that reaction from them. That is how we feed ourselves in social media, from those reactions that bring up the emotions that are produced when something cool happens with the content that we have produced. Do I want that reactions? Is that what I’m aiming to? I’m not sure, I don’t think. What makes more sense to me is a different way of interacting with the internet, one on which I add value consistently in a way that is more focused, on which people have to spend more of their time in. When they go into social media, their frame of reference is not related to ‘I want to better understand about life, so I’ll go into twitter to find out how to be a better human being’. Or maybe it is, I don’t really know, but I know that twitter for me is not about growing and growing, it is about having an avenue on which to express my thoughts and engage with cool people. That is what I need to start doing, engaging with cool people from which I can learn. I haven’t done it consistently and it is something that will bring value to my life, because it is good to share and learn from other people. But don’t get crazyon the quest of adding followers, because that is not the means on which people will get to this DAO. It needs to be more focused than that.\n\n    And where does that focus come from? What comes to mind is spaces with like minded individuals. Ancient psyuchoneats that want to deeper ex`pre consciousness. The ones that hang out in rowid, the ones that have had a psychedelic therapy and have a experiential understanding that there is more than what they have experienced, and want to tap into that. The ones that want to create a major shift in their life, and who are willing to create a creative expression that is absolutely unique to theirs. The ones that are able to take a month out of their work, their life, so that they can become more and more of what they truly are. That is the mission of this whole thing, to use all these tools to help people to become more of what they truly are, what they have always been.\n\n    The means for this is acknowledging the origins of the word therapists, that in greek mans something like: ‘That who has the power to hold space for other people to heal themselves0. This whole thing is about healing, but healing from a place of wanting to face the strongest demons, and more through life with the integration of that process of being a witness. Each of us is a witness of the own demons that run through the mind of that person, and in the understanding of that as. A reality there is a freedom that comes. There is a particular aspect of human existence that resonates with this whole thing, and that is your soul. Who you are beyond you. What underlies your whole expression. Your core being. Your true self. Awareness itself. You are awareness, wanting to express itsel through the vessel that JP is. That is the amazing part of thins whole journey, how much of this is connected to the past and to the future. If you are able to recognize the past in your present, you will be heading to the future with a strong udnderstanding of who you are, and that will open the doors of any endeavor that you decide to start because presence is the whighest form of intelligence.  It is huge. It is a miracle.\n\n    It is time to acknowledge the miracle and start living from that acknowledgment. With gratitude, one of the most important aspects of the human experience. Gratitude for all of what has been, for all that is. For the truth of what is. For what comes after the integration of that truth in your self. Of being that truth. This whole experience and every one of them will be an exploration into that truth, and how each of our individual human expressions are the means by which it is expressed in the world. It is a window into the marveling for that. About that. Let yourself be in awe, full of wonder, because each moment that exists is a present. Everything that you are experiencing right now is a present that your former self is giving you, and in each aspect of it there is something that could be thought of as joyful.\n\n    It is easy to forget the particular gift that each of us brings to the world, because it is hard to realize what it is. In the morning I was talking to a colleague and she told me about how scarce it is to have people that are willing to hold space. To just hold space for things to happen. And that’s crazy, because for me it is such a natural thing, that I never stopped for a while to realize how valuable it is. If she hadn’t told me, I would have taken it as a must, as something that is present in the human experience per se, and it would have gone like that. But because she told it to me, I came into the realization that yes, it is something scarce, it is something valuable, and I see myself and what I do differently after that realization. So the invitation that I’m making to you as I bring this story up is for you to realize what is that value in you that you are not being able to see. Open yourself to the world, share yourself, so that the world can reflect you back and tell you what that present that you are bringing is.\n\nIf I come and ask you: Who are you? Who is the one that is receiving that question? What is that question bringing up in your system? What are the layers that your mind builds right away to explain rationally who you are? What do those layers tell you about yourself and the way on which you see yourself? All of this is information, it is what will help you to realize that you are not the only one that pushes himself down. You are not the only one that thinks that she is not enough. It happens to all of us, and in the acknowledgement of that there is a collective power that can be unleashed. It is very common in our modern society to spend a long time comparing our experience with the one of others, and what that brings is a difficulty in being truly happy for other person’s success. That is something that happens, and it is something that we need to acknowledge so that we can move on with the integration of what were the means that created this as a consequence. Then we were young we were conditioned to believe that our success is determined by the scale that we hold in a particular range of people. If I have better grades, I’m more capable at X than the person that is next to me. That comparison is horrible, it creates a lot of hard, and it is one of the things that will be evolving throughout the Yeats. It is quite obvious right now that the way out is not being independent and having the best grades in class, but being interdependent and finding solutions with each other. I was never told truly how to work as a team, and it is something that I lack completely. But it doesn’t need to stay there forever, because as soon that it is realized as a consequence of what has happened, I’m able to break free from it as a conditioning. It is very deep in my structure and how I see the world, but the brain is constantly evolving and there can be a time on which this conditioning is not there anymore.\n\n    There is a big sensation of sleepiness, which bringing memories of how nice it is to have the eyes closed and just listen to the music. There are memories running through of many different electronic music parties, dancing at the center of the dance floor always with the eyes closed. Not caring about anything that was going on the outside, just feeling and experiencing what the music was bringing in the inside. Such amazing meoments of exploration into just being. Just taking care of that moment, and fully being the music. SO much learning and value as been derived from al of that experience. It is felt as a massage to the brain, as a breaking free of throughs, or more than breaking free from throughs, it is about breaking free from the necessity of controlling them. Just letting them flow freely through the whole system, and now there is a willingness present of just enjoying it. But that same willingness builds up a separation between the muysc and my Self, because it is always referencing something that will happen in the future. One day I will clean this part of the house. One day I will build up the space for us to grow vegetables. It is always related to the future, and how I will be able to control the future in order ro have a beetter life. Always that life conditioned to what can happen afterwards, not what is happening now. That is part of what is being brought up in this process, and it is brutal to be a true witness of that. To see from the inside of my being the way on which the mind works, always telling stories, always being trapped somewhere in that limbo of the past and future. What should have been, what could be. Always dancing in that limbo, but eventually grasping towards the balance.There is knowledge about where that balance is, about where it has been all the time. It is there, inside, waiting for me to realize it and embrace its location. Closer than close. That is the place where the pond of the mind stops having ripples and it becomes clear, transparent. That is where stuff starts getting interesting, because the knowledge comes from a place of truth. Of true knowing. And there is knowledge that that place is related to balance, to getting into that place of stillness within.\n\n· · ·\n\n    Have you done some of the work that is needed to dissolve the stuff within you that feels uncomfortable? Or more than feeling uncomfortable, that make you feel identified with those feelings. There are aspects of you that identify with those situations, feelings and sensations unconsciously, and if you don’t do the work of making them part of your conscious processes they will always be there, making you feel identified with them. That is part of the work that you have to do, bringing that into the conscious patterns, shining a light on them, so that you can move towards an integration of all those aspects into yourself. This will free up amazing amounts of energy that are stuck in those patterns, and all that energy will be available to be used in the pursuit of something different. Something creative. All your creativity will be fueled with all this energy that will be freed. You came here to just be. Enjoy that. Enjoy yourself and everything that you are capable of.\n\n· · ·\n\n    There is a certain judgment present related to not being such deep in a state of flow while writing today. There is a feeling present that is more… Passive. There is not too much coming out, and that is interesting because it is an exploration into what happens when there is permission to just write whatever comes up. To report from there. This ends up being the same as that game of self inquiry dyads, of prompting the other person ‘Tell me who you are’, and just letting that person report what comes up. So this is me reporting whatever comes up in this process of trying to write about what it feels to awaken. I don’t really know how it feels to awaken, it seems like I will be all this lifetime running behind something that runs much faster than me, but I can certainly tell you how it feels to run and run and run and not reach it. It is exhausting, but at the same time fulfilling. There is a deep sense that there is nothing more important to do than this. That there is nothing more important than knowing the truth. How could anything be more important than knowing the truth? There is a deep wondering of how can this not be as true for other people as it is for the one that is writing this words with his 10 fingers. What other endeavor could be more important than knowing the truth? Saving the world from climate change? Helping my local community to strengthen their bonds? Writing a book? I don’t really know, but for me, it certainly feels that there couldn’t be anything more important than this. So that’s why I come back to playing this game, of just reporting what comes, so that there can be a process of emptying inside. There is strong need of becoming empty, of all the words that had to be said but never were said, of all the messages that wanted to be conveyed but never were. Of all the people that wanted to be approached but that feeling of insecurity wouldn’t let it happen. It doesn’t really matter now, or it matters, because it is material for doing the process of integration of what is present here. Of what has always been present, in one way or another. Every story is a summary of all of the others. As above, so below, in everything, everywhere, all the time. Each thing that happens throughout your lifetime is a window of exploration into everything that has ever been, and everything that will ever be. As soon as you start realizing this you will be free, because there won’t be a necessity of being in a place different from where you are, so that you can achieve something ‘more’. Everything is here, right now, today. Everything that you need to be is here, right now, today. Realize that, and be free. This is the time for it. This is the perfect time.\n\n    There is a remembering of the words that were written previously. All the time running on the back of something that runs much much much faster than me. That has way more resources. So what if I stopped running? What if I stopped chasing it? How would the relationship with it evolve because of that ceasing? What a nice exploration that is. Stop running and let it just be. That is the key, to stop running. To realize more and more all those times that there has been someone running, and just make it conscious for it to stop. There is no need for you to be running, there is only a need for you to be. A need that comes from within, so that the deepest layers of who you are can be expressed through each action that your being goes through. Each action, each moment, is a window into eternity. How do you want to be remembered? As eternity itself, and for that, you need to forget who you are. You need to lose yourself into what you are doing, and the way into that is not trying. It is just doing. Every action is an exploration into the power of just doing. Just do. Just explore. There are no direct consequences, each consequence is just an invention of the mind, because all that exists is only a succession of moments that are one window after the other one. It doesn’t really matter. It truly doesn’t really matter. It just is. It will always be. Every moment will always just be, and every thought that the mind can generate about it is just that, a construct that comes from the mind and its preferences. Learn to recognize that, and break free from the identification from them. You are not the thoughts, those are just an interpretation of what is going on. But what is going on is going on, and no interpretation is more than just, an interpretation. Each human being has a different interpretation, and it is impossible for each of us to understand what the interpretation of another person is, because it is fundamentally different. You see life through you own lens. Realize that, and become free from the need for other people to understand how your lens looks like. Become free from understanding how the lens of other people look like. Just enjoy it. Be amazed by it. Be in awe. Each life experience is a window into the understanding of human nature, into the understanding of how each of us is built because of its life experiences. Give yourself the permission to be free. Give yourself the permission to realize that you are not in control of the interpretation that other people have of your actions. They have the freedom to build an image of who you are in their own minds, and this is not something that is at the reach of your control. Be free of wanting to control that. Just be free. Just express yourself as free as you can, and let them have their trip. Let each person have their own trip. And enjoy it from your perspective. Be amazed by what they say to you, and learn to see in each judgment an invitation to a deeper understanding of their own journey.\n\nIf they judge you about the food you eat, what does that tell you about the relationship that they have with the food that they eat?\n\nIf they judge you about what you say, how secure are they about what they say?\n\nIf they judge you about your friends, on top of what are their friendships built?\n\nIf they judge you about what you decide not to do, what does that tell you about their capacity to say no?\n\nEach interaction is an opportunity to learn more about the human experience. Enjoy the ride. It is quite a fun one. Each of us has its own stuff buried inside. Realize this and be free of the one that you have. It is not your burden, it is just the reality of how things are right now. Don’t be identified by them. Let them just be. They are. Let things be right as they are.\nAnd this is what will end up happening. What you have been witnessing as you read what I write here. Stuff just wants to come out, in whatever form. There is no need to control the form, there is no need to control what actually comes out. That would be related to a particular judgement of things being in a different way from what they actually are. From me being someone different from who I am, but this is who I am, this is everything that I am, and I’m presenting myself with that here, now. It’s time to embrace it and just let it express itself through this words. There will come a time on which I come back here and read what was written and recognize me through this words, but for now, what I need is only to bring them out. To make space inside. For it to shine through.\n\nI always wonder about artists that have lost themselves in their craft. When Freddie Mercury sings ‘Surrender your ego, be free, be free’. Is he singing from a place of non-duality? Has he realized his true nature and he is speaking from that place? Which is the difference from inhabiting life from that place and from the place on which he sings? Does there need to be a deep exploration into all these means that are used for transcending the ego and the mind when the creative expression has reached a point like that? That is a wondering that runs a lot through my mind, as I move towards finding my own way of expressing my voice, of sharing it with the world.\n\n· · ·\n\nRight now thoughts come through related to the gap that old people have with technology and their lack of understanding of it, and me talking to my parents the other day, trying to tell them about what I experienced in the retreat that I went in Canada, which’s main objective was to generate conditions of no escape for the ego, so that awareness could realize itself and I could become free. I found myself talking to them about all this concepts, trying to be as clear as I could, but knowing that on their mind everything that I was saying was just noise. There is a big gap there, and as I was helping my mother with her phone now I realize that that gap was also there. Is it that they don’t want to open up to the possibility of knowing? Where does all that come from? Throughs like that come to my mind, because there is a need of wanting to help them, but not really knowing how to do it. Let them have their trip, it is ok if they don’t know how to do it. The frustration is more in me, that I know what is possible, than in then, that they don’t know.\n\nIf I talk about being conscious and this whole awakening thing, there is frustration in me when they don’t understand what I’m talking about because I know that there is something that they could be seeing and they are not. There is a bigger aspect of reality that they are missing because the frame of reference from which they are interacting with this whole thing is limited. But it is limited in my view, in the projection that I create inside myself about their experience here. It is not limited in their view, because their view is contained in the reference points from which they explore this thing. So these limitations are just built on my mind, not in theirs, and that creates this frustration, but in myself. I am the one that wants them to experience something more. They are not. So when is the point that I truly realize this and become free of the burden of wanting to show them that there is something more?\n\nThe same goes for technology, and this is where this parallel starts to make sense. As I see them interact with it, and not understand, and eventually give up, there is a feeling of frustration in me related to what they are missing out by not facing what happens when you try to figure things out. At the end, all this technology thing is an eternal trial and error, on which you make mistakes and then you learn from there, understanding what you need to do the next time so that you don’t make those mistakes. It goes like this on and on. But in the case of older people who grew without it, when they were young a mistake was much more expensive than now. It was not as easy as now to delete it and start fresh. So there is a much bigger resistance in them to expose themselves to mistakes, because they are conditioned by their experience to suffer more consequences from them than what is true right now. And that is the aspect that is interesting about this parallel that I’m making. On my view of them, they are lacking something, they are not living to their full potential, because they are not giving themselves the space to make those mistakes and learn from them. They are missing out of a huge opportunity of taking more advantage of the tools that they have at hand. But that is only in my mind, in my experience, because I am the one that knows the gap between the usage that they are giving to their energy now. I am the one that knows how much space for growth they have. But they are not. And they don’t care about it. They just enjoy whatever limited thing they are doing, and from there they learn how to make the best out of it. They truly don’t care about where that limit is, because for them that limit is already there, at the boundary of what they do. They don’t want to go further down from that boundary. And it is ok like that. But now I’m able to recognize this, as I see myself trying to bridge that gap for them.\n\nI see that they use X percent of their capabilities, both in their phone and in their existence as human beings, and I want that X to grow because I know that there is a lot of space for growth. But they don’t want. So what does this produce in the interaction of us= From my side, frustration because my expectation of what can be achieved in the interaction of them with the technology or with themselves is not met, and in them also frustration because I’m bot seeing them for who they truly are, I’m seeing them through the image that I think that they can become. I see who they can become if they are able to do what I think is good for them, and I put this image between me and my interaction with them, so there is always a misrepresentation between what I see of them, and what I expect from them. And this brings suffering, so the good thing to do would be to just speak their language, and learn from their perspective of things.\n\nThey are a human being as valuable as me, and as soon as I open myself to learn from them as they are now, I set up myself for a growth that is not present right now. AS soon as I become a witness from their interaction with a particular piece of technology, I open myself to the possibility of learning how to become a better builder of systems, because I can create something more accessible thinking on the means that they have at their hand. Not what I expect them to do so that they use the whole potential of the thing (their human condition and their phone) but by who they actually are, and the way that they actually interact with their stuff. This is the magic of meeting people were they are, and not thinking that I’m in a different place than them because I know more about myself or I know better how to use a particularr piece of technology. This is a big bias from the mind, wanting to believe that it is in a different place because of the journey that has been travelled, not having in mind that each journey is unique in its own way, and that each moment, each interaction, is a window into a better understanding of oneself.\n\nWhat happens if instead of correcting my mother for what she did ‘wrong’ in her interaction with her phone, I sat down a bit longer with that willingness to help her and realized where it is coming from? What could I learn from me in that process?\n\nWhat if instead of wanting them to evolve spiritually in a particular way, I opened myself up to recieving whoever their are at this stage of evolution and let that speak to me about their true self and how it expresses through that particular person in that particular moment.\n\nAlways have in mind that time is a construct of the mind, and the fact that I think that there is a particular ‘evolution’ towards something that is taking place is a construct of the mind, because each of us is already and have always been everything that we will ever be in any particular moment. It is just about taking out the sheet that won’t let it be seen between any mind and the expression of reality that is in fromt of my eyes. Open yourself to the true understanding of what is going on in front of your eyes. And more than the true understanding, the full experiencing of it. There is no understanding to be had, just a full experiencing it, with all the senses, with all the body, with all the being. Just open yourself to receive, and be open to what that is telling you about yourself. Always, every moment, with every person, is a window of exploration Ito yourself, as you are able to recognize who you are in the eyes of the other person, in the story of the other person, in what that person has inside. Open up to the possibility for things to be not as you want them to be. Open up to the possibility of accepting everything just as it is. There is the magic. That is the pathless path. It has always been here, just below your feet, in every moment. Take out the shoes of the understanding and open up the feelings and sensations that come just from putting the feet in the ground and receiving what is already there. Everything that needs to be is already. Open up to the experiencing of that as a manifestation of the infinite love that is ever present inside each corner of reality. Each atom is a manifestation of that love.\n\n· · ·\nI can’t write about what it feels to be awake, I’m not there yet, and maybe I’ll never will. Who knows. I’m forgetting about that constant willingness to be in a particular place, and connecting every day more with what is already here. I can’t write about what it is to be awake, but I can write about how life is when you want it desperately. When you really want to get out of Dukkha, because it hurts. The constant seeking feels like having the head on fire, and the only thing that you want to find is a pond on which to relieve that pain. And you are in the middle of the desert, and it feels that you will never find that pond and your head burns and burns and burns. And you really want to get out of it. You really want to happen. And then someone tells you that the only way in is trhgouh. The only thing that you can do for it to stop is stop wanting it to stop. Give up the wanting. Open up to what is there, and accepting it with every atom of your body. Holy shit, what a cosmic joke that is. And it makes all the sense of the world, and every aspect f existence is telling us about it. The more you walk away from something, the clearer it shows up in your existence so that you can face it with all of what you are. It happened to us with the birth of our young daughter, on which we really didn’t want a C section and we wanted it to go as smoothly as it could. But it ended up being a nightmare and we suffered a lot. That is the biggest expression that I have had in my life related to running away from something just to go closer to it, and right now this whole awakening game is becoming the same. I travel the world looking for the answers on how to get out of the puzzle, and I don’t seem to reach nowhere. There is clarity inside that the way on which progress will be made is just by giving up the quest, letting the seeker become exhausted, but it has a lot of energy. It truly never gives up, it is very very very persistent, and it is fuuuucking exhausting. But it is becoming more and more clear than it feels very good to give up. To stop seeking. Those small glimpses that have been had on which the tension is relieved and the seeking has stopped are windows of opportunity that talk about how things will look like when there is an absolute allowance for them to be just as they are. This doesn’t mean to be passive and not do anything, it is quite the opposite. It is action with intention, but without bonding to the particular consequence of that action. It is action with the freedom that comes from not being attached to what happens afterwards. It is action from a place of love, not from a place of ego. It is action from a place of wanting to express, not from a place of wanting to be seen. It doesn’t matter if someone sees you, what matters is that it is out there. That is the beauty of this thing, and I come back to what was written at the beginning of this day, about modern technologies and platforms being kind of a one way repository of material, on which you set something free out there and people can interact with it without giving you direct feedback on what did they bring into their world. We are creating something like a parallel reality, on which we can throw out all of our unconscious in there and leave all of what we are for the material one.

This whole experience and every one of them will be an exploration into that truth, and how each of our individual human expressions are the means by which it is expressed in the world. It is a window into the marveling for that. About that. Let yourself be in awe, full of wonder, because each moment that exists is a present.

It is very common in our modern society to spend a long time comparing our experience with the one of others, and what that brings is a difficulty in being truly happy for other person\\u2019s success. That is something that happens, and it is something that we need to acknowledge so that we can move on with the integration of what were the means that created this as a consequence. Then we were young we were conditioned to believe that our success is determined by the scale that we hold in a particular range of people. If I have better grades, I\\u2019m more capable at X than the person that is next to me. That comparison is horrible, it creates a lot of hard, and it is one of the things that will be evolving throughout the Yeats.

Just taking care of that moment, and fully being the music. SO much learning and value as been derived from al of that experience.

This ends up being the same as that game of self inquiry dyads, of prompting the other person \\u2018Tell me who you are\\u2019, and just letting that person report what comes up. So this is me reporting whatever comes up in this process of trying to write about what it feels to awaken. I don\\u2019t really know how it feels to awaken, it seems like I will be all this lifetime running behind something that runs much faster than me, but I can certainly tell you how it feels to run and run and run and not reach it. It is exhausting, but at the same time fulfilling. There is a deep sense that there is nothing more important to do than this. That there is nothing more important than knowing the truth.

How would the relationship with it evolve because of that ceasing? What a nice exploration that is. Stop running and let it just be. That is the key, to stop running. To realize more and more all those times that there has been someone running, and just make it conscious for it to stop. There is no need for you to be running, there is only a need for you to be. A need that comes from within, so that the deepest layers of who you are can be expressed through each action that your being goes through. Each action, each moment, is a window into eternity. How do you want to be remembered? As eternity itself, and for that, you need to forget who you are. You need to lose yourself into what you are doing, and the way into that is not trying. It is just doing. Every action is an exploration into the power of just doing. Just do. Just explore. There are no direct consequences, each consequence is just an invention of the mind, because all that exists is only a succession of moments that are one window after the other one. It doesn\\u2019t really matter. It truly doesn\\u2019t really matter. It just is. It will always be.

It is just about taking out the sheet that won\\u2019t let it be seen between any mind and the expression of reality that is in fromt of my eyes. Open yourself to the true understanding of what is going on in front of your eyes. And more than the true understanding, the full experiencing of it. There is no understanding to be had, just a full experiencing it, with all the senses, with all the body, with all the being. Just open yourself to receive, and be open to what that is telling you about yourself. Always, every moment, with every person, is a window of exploration Ito yourself, as you are able to recognize who you are in the eyes of the other person, in the story of the other person, in what that person has inside. Open up to the possibility for things to be not as you want them to be. Open up to the possibility of accepting everything just as it is. There is the magic. That is the pathless path. It has always been here, just below your feet, in every moment. Take out the shoes of the understanding and open up the feelings and sensations that come just from putting the feet in the ground and receiving what is already there. Everything that needs to be is already. Open up to the experiencing of that as a manifestation of the infinite love that is ever present inside each corner of reality. Each atom is a manifestation of that love.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:`\\xB7 \\xB7 \\xB7\nI can\\u2019t write about what it feels to be awake, I\\u2019m not there yet, and maybe I\\u2019ll never will. Who knows. I\\u2019m forgetting about that constant willingness to be in a particular place, and connecting every day more with what is already here. I can\\u2019t write about what it is to be awake, but I can write about how life is when you want it desperately. When you really want to get out of Dukkha, because it hurts. The constant seeking feels like having the head on fire, and the only thing that you want to find is a pond on which to relieve that pain. And you are in the middle of the desert, and it feels that you will never find that pond and your head burns and burns and burns. And you really want to get out of it. You really want to happen. And then someone tells you that the only way in is trhgouh. The only thing that you can do for it to stop is stop wanting it to stop. Give up the wanting. Open up to what is there, and accepting it with every atom of your body. Holy shit, what a cosmic joke that is. And it makes all the sense of the world, and every aspect f existence is telling us about it. The more you walk away from something, the clearer it shows up in your existence so that you can face it with all of what you are. It happened to us with the birth of our young daughter, on which we really didn\\u2019t want a C section and we wanted it to go as smoothly as it could. But it ended up being a nightmare and we suffered a lot. That is the biggest expression that I have had in my life related to running away from something just to go closer to it, and right now this whole awakening game is becoming the same. I travel the world looking for the answers on how to get out of the puzzle, and I don\\u2019t seem to reach nowhere. There is clarity inside that the way on which progress will be made is just by giving up the quest, letting the seeker become exhausted, but it has a lot of energy. It truly never gives up, it is very very very persistent, and it is fuuuucking exhausting. But it is becoming more and more clear than it feels very good to give up. To stop seeking. Those small glimpses that have been had on which the tension is relieved and the seeking has stopped are windows of opportunity that talk about how things will look like when there is an absolute allowance for them to be just as they are. This doesn\\u2019t mean to be passive and not do anything, it is quite the opposite. It is action with intention, but without bonding to the particular consequence of that action. It is action with the freedom that comes from not being attached to what happens afterwards. It is action from a place of love, not from a place of ego. It is action from a place of wanting to express, not from a place of wanting to be seen. It doesn\\u2019t matter if someone sees you, what matters is that it is out there. That is the beauty of this thing, and I come back to what was written at the beginning of this day, about modern technologies and platforms being kind of a one way repository of material, on which you set something free out there and people can interact with it without giving you direct feedback on what did they bring into their world. We are creating something like a parallel reality, on which we can throw out all of our unconscious in there and leave all of what we are for the material one. The internet is the place where we become free of everything that we are not, so that we can be everything that we are in the open space of how we interact with the human beings that live in the place where we have decided to live our life.`}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"By allowing yourself to be creative just for the sake of it and share it with the world through the internet, without caring about the consequences of it, you open up to the possibility of freeing yourself from what is inside.

          "raw": "\nThis whole game that I have been describing through my writing is very related to the word truth. To bring about the truth of your being into your awareness, so that from there you can be free. And a big element of the human experience that is present right now for me is the capacity, or the tendency, or whatever it is for us to not trust in ourselves enough so that we can share our voice, the unique thing that we bring. It is so easy to hide ourselves behind the willingness to do something good, but not be able to open up to share it because your truth feels weird It doesn’t feel what people have been used to hear from you, so it feels weird to do it. It is always that voice inside the head that is telling yo that the work is not good enough, that you are not worthy of attention from those who want to listen. And this game of awakening is waking up to that truth also, to the truth that it doesn’t really matter, because the creative process itself is not dependent on what people think directly. You do your thing, and then you share it. There may be an aspect of feedback that transforms what you are doing as you are doing it (I’m taking right now about a musician on stage that decides to do something different because of the crowd giving some particular feedback about it), but in that case, the feedback is being used constructively for the artist to evolve what she is doing. It is food for the creation that is taking oplace, not something that pushes it down. And that is where I’m trying to get at here, that food for creation can be sometimes constructive or descrutctive, depending on the way on which the artist receives it. And the more connected you are to the source, the less damage this feedback does to you in a destructive way, because you create from a place different than that which worries about people not being happy with what you do. That is part of the game of awakening the truth, to your truth…. Realizing the game of creativity and how it is played, as you become more and more free of the conditioning that you have to please the people that you create for.\n\nWho do you create for in the first place? That is the question that should be asked. Who is the receptor of your creation? What comes to mind right now is the story about Vincent Van Gogh (or a painter like that), who sold just 1 painting throughout his life in the equivalent of 16 euros of now, and then lately died because of a disease without knowing anything about the success that he will have later. But he was true, he was doing his thing for something more than fame or fortune. He was doing it from a deep place of within, which enabled him to have a particular artistic expression that was unique to who he was. Perhaps his unique expression was not related to selling his paintings, or becoming famous in any way, but it is like that, he was able to find means to express it in a different way, and his mark is there. Was he worse because he didn’t have the recognition of the public, feedback, when he was alive? No, not at all. He created something so unique, so perfectly his, that he was recognized by it afterwards, and his ego did not become attached to what he was creating in the sense that it would if he new that people were paying attention.\n\nThat is something very interesting about this internet age, how in many cases the important thing is the ideas that are behind the person, more than the person itself. It you are able to convey something that appeals to people and resonates with them, there is no need for you to be you. The internet doesn’t care about that. That whole structure of who you have been is that, a construct, which does not need to be in place for this game to be played. At the end, what do you want people to recognize you for? Do you even want to be recognized r you just want to enjoy life? I put the word or in there, as if they were not complementary concepts. Of course you can be recognized and enjoy life, but I have the feeling that there will always be this small aspect of ego that will not leave you alone. And if you create stuff without labelling it with your name there is a particular kind of freedom, that I, myself, as not experienced completely. Maybe it is time to play the game and start building from there, to see what comes up. To explore the game a little bit and realize how fun it can be to have no name. On having no head. On having no name.\n\nAnd then we get into the difference of a person that has no name and a bot in Twitter for example. How could you tell the difference in the long run of someone that has no name, no personal identity attached and a bot? Is it even a good thing to have no name? What is the relationship of having no name in social media and publishing from that place and awakening to your true nature? All these things are coming from the mind, there is an eternal need inside there that wants to know, that wants to better understand the consequence of what it does so that it can control better the outcomes. And that is the eternal game of the ‘what could happen if…?’. There is no way out of that game, because there is a fundamental impossibility of knowing if action is not taken. The only way to know is to take action, is to do the thing. It is to bring it out from the mind and into the world, which is another aspect of mind, but one that is shared. There his the internal aspect of the mind that is the one that goes running and running in circles inside the head, inside myself, and then there is the collective aspect of mind that is where we all are. It is the place where what I do interacts with what you have done and from there both of us evolve in our particular ways into something different that can be completely different from what was happening inside the mind of each of the participants and the movie that was being played inside there. Kopfikno. That is the word. The cinema of the mind. That word has always stuck with me, because it is so true. The mind is always playing a story that s related to its conditioning, to what has gone throughout its life, and from there it is able to try and predict what will happen in the future. We are the best predicting the future, but the worse predictors. Which is the idea of predicting the future? Yes, of course that planning is one of those things, but is it that important to pan? That is something that I wonder a lot, because my father is the best planner of them all. Everything is measured and planned, and it is something that of course has worked for him in his life, but I really wonder if it is something that is condiment to the expression of the soul.\n\nTo the truth.\n\nHow is planning connected to the truth? I plan to sit down and meditate, and I plan that I won’t get up for one hour, until that bell rings. And it ends up being interesting, because from that planning all what arises in the meditation is a consequence of that, and I learn a lot of myself in that process, and I evolve my practice by learning a little more about how to be equanimous, in a energetically and biological way. So that planning is helpful, because I’m able to carve out some time to sit down and just be, so that I can better feel how it feels to be, and bring it about in all my other interactions. That is cool, you know. TO ´be here, writing all this without too much sense, and finding out stories and conclusions about wmyself, about how I relate to reality, about what is important in this game.\n\nI feel now that the best way to do this is by creating an avatar that doesn0t have name, with the story that I wanted to tell about it hidden insid. But I don’t know how to tell stories other than that of myself, so it will be similar to my story. To my quest. I want to share my story beca´use this is how it feels to be a perpetual seeker, to be involved with Dukkha at the bottom of your toes. There is nothing that is enough, and I want to break free. But I even doubt if this is my ego that wants to evolve spiritually, and then go and create stuff under this ego so that the image that the world has of itself is different and cooler. Do I really want the image of myself to be cooler or this is just an exploration into what I want to create? The good thing about creating this whole thing under the image of a creation that doesn’t exist in reality (that whole thing is another creation of the mind, because if this character is built through the internet, and it doesn’t have a human being attached on its name, isn’t it true? Isn’t it real? Of course it is real. And of course that it has a human character attached in its back. I will be there, pulling the strings, until there are no boundaries and the strings become me. Until the hands merge with what is being pulled, and from there, stuff starts happening. It is nice to hide behind my face and hide behind the fact that I say that I’m being truthful with my truth, but is is hard to give up the identification of that truth with me. That is the step that I feel that needs to be taken now, the full dissolving of my identity in the way that I speak about awakening. I need to become free from the attachment of my ego of ‘wanting to be awake’. That’s what Jed McKenna did with his book. He wrote it from a perspective of someone that is not actually present there, probably because of the consequence that writing that book would have on the perspective on which he saw himself, and other people saw himself also. There is beauty, there is value, on breaking free of the identification with what people think about you, and in creating from that place. Van Gogh created from a place of pure expression, and what remains from him is just his art. Nothing else matters. What he brought to the world is what stays, not who he was particularly. Who he was is translated into everything that he painted, and it that, he freed himself on having to realize who he was, because it was an eternal exploration through what he did. This is similar to just being. You are in the sense the you let yourself be. And the expression of that being ends up being the creation of stuff, just for the sake of it. That’s all of what I have been talking about today, about the consequences of creating just for the sake of it, without attachments to the consequences of that creation. My mother knitted socks, but those creations are fully conditioned to her ego because the only way on which she shares her work is by giving them out as a present, for free, so that people can use them and tell their friends that she was the one that made them. There is always an attachment there related to someone telling that you were the one that did something. What is that attachment is not related to my persona, but for a secondary character that I create in the world and who is in charge of doing something cool out there? I have been sharing consistently through Instagram this week breath work sessions, but it is getting to a point where I don’t know if it is helping me anymore. Of course it helps, because there is information that comes from the fact that I’m able to share my truth with the world, but, do I really need to do it? Is it a step into the transition of opening that is created when you are able to share your truth without wanting to change other people? That is part of my intention while doing what I’m doing there. Explore into the sensations that come. Share my truth. Share everything that I am now, so that people can better understand the point where I am at. Is it necessary? I feel it as doing the due diligence for people to better get me. Do I need to do it? The easier way would be to create for me an account not associated to my name, and create for there. Is that the way forward? I don’t really need to ask this questions to myself, I just need to do it and explore. There are ways on which this can be manifested, and I guess that it is time to do it.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto did his thing without the need of having to be recognized, and it must be freeing to have it done it that way. There must be true value on your name not being attached to your identity. Is that a correct way to put it? I don’t really know which is the relationship of identity and name, what is each of those concepts. I just use them because it feels that it is what needs to be said, but I’m not completely sure about what I’m saying. I’m just saying it. Then I will come back and review, but for now the most important thing for me is to just throw what is present away, report what is present and just be from there.\n\nWhat is present now is a certain willingness in the body to sit down with the eyes closed and stare inside. This last weeks have been brutal in the sense that the internal energy is continuing to build up, and there doesn’t seem to be a stopping of this thing. I wonder when it will explode, because it keeps going up and u. And this here is like my valve of escape, the place on which I come to write about this whole process so that I can have something written for afterwards come and realize how crazy I am. I was. I will always be. I’m crazy and you are too, the thing is that I just acknowledge it. I don’t care pointing myself with the flashlight and saying that I’m crazy, because it doesn’t matter. What is it to be crazy, anyway, more than not meeting the expectations that people have of your behavior. That is being crazy, and there are so many crazy people out there that are not even able to realize it because they want to fit. Trying to fit is like putting your soul in a blender in maximum speed. Trying to fit is acknowledging that there is something in you that wants to be expressed but not having the guts to do it. Trying to fit is spending the precious life force that you have inside in the game of other different than yourself and the people with which you relate. Which is the boundary of the people with which you relate, nowadays, anyway? Is there a boundary? I can create my twitter account and the amount of people with which I relate can grow exponentially, because relating to someone is having an impact in their expression of consciousness, and as soon as I create a piece of content and someone interacts with it, I’m in. I made it. I’m relating to them, in a very deep way. That is the game we are playing here, that of relating to one another in ways that we don’t imagine, in ways that we don’t understand.\n\n· · ·\n\nWhat is this whole thing about? I’m going through that all the time, running around in my mind, realizing the road that I’m in. I don’t really understand. I don’t really know where I’m heading. I’m confused. In some moments it feels like I have complete clarity on the way that I’m doing progress, and on other moments there is no clarity at all. I don’t know where I’m going. But my heart knows. What if I left the doubts behind and I just pushed forward with it. Why do I need to run in circles without having feedback from the world? Isn’t having feedback the nice thing about this? Isn’t learning if it will be useful for someone the whole point of the thing? That’s how it is supposed to work nowadays. You create something, you wait for the feedback to come and then you evolve from there. But what if people don’t understand what you are doing? What happened to Van Gogh? If he had waited for the feedback from the people, where would he have ended? That is the thing. I can spend days searching blindly for feedback, or I just can go for it and bring about something from the depth of my soul. What do I prefer? To be sincere. I prefer to go for it, because that is the work that is being done here. It is about facing the demons with all of what I have. I tend to say that the open source factory was a waste of time, but it wasn’t. It trained me to what I’m doing now. It was the preparation stage for this game. It was what needed to happen before I got to where I am at now. To bringing about all this writing with the consistency and discipline that is needed to build something amazing. The important part is building something amazing. And this maze of words is amazing in and of itself. It is something that if no one comes to it, it doesn’t matter because it helped me to take out what I needed to take out of myself to evolve.\n\nIt is the ever asking of the prompt: Tell me who you are. TELL ME WHO YOU ARE. I yell at myself. Who the fuck are you! I want to know. I really want to know. Show me your real self, your real being. Show me the truth of who you are. Show me the truth of what is hidden behind all this thoughts, all these words, all these smiles to random people in the world, all this willingness to explore what it means to be alive, all these different creations that have come about in the last years, from polishing pieces of wood for people to paint on them to creating random websites to do the work. To show up and do the work. That is the thing, doing the work. That’s why I’m here, for doing the work. Until I don’t realize that, I won’t be free. It is time to be free. I will be free. The only way in is through, and in this case, through is into the work. Into every word that show up itself. Into every concept, every image, every process that shows up through these words. The information is all here. This is magic. It is so easy for me to think that it is easy to show up and write 7000 words in one day. It is no easy. It is so easy for me to think that it is easy to show up. It is not. Most people don’t show up because they don’t care enough. I care. I care more than more. Awareness is closer than close, and I care more than more. The world is fucked up, and it is time to wake up. It is time to Do The Work. You may ask, what is Doing The Work? It is showing up to stare at yourself deeply. It is using the tools that we will develop in the DAO as the means of exploring who you are as deep as you can.\n\nThe ancient yogis showed up within themselves and were able to explore their consciousness by developing techniques over and over again, for thousands of years. We don’t have that time right now, it is time for us to wake up. It is time for us to gather up forces as a collective and evolve together, helping each other in the process. It is time for us to develop the transformational journeys that will take us to the other side. Iterating. Learning from mistakes. Together. Developing a timetable of 21 days on which each day will have specific things to do, to Do The Work. DTW. It is almost like DFW, the one that kickstarted this whole thing for me. My mentor, and he didn’t know it. With his book The Infinite Jest, he kickstarted the whole thing. Now the letters are coming back. DTW is kind of the same than DFW and I didn’t realize that until now. Do The Work. David Foster Wallace. I’m going to make sure that your legacy is not wasted, David. We will find a way to treat and cure depression together. Now is the time. I’m creating a time machine on which more and more people will get in, and become transformed. Something huge is starting, and this is the beginning of it.\n\nDo The Fucking Work. Maybe that’s what the F means. DTFW. David The Foster Wallace. Do The Fucking Work. It is time to do the work. Show up. What I’m creating is for you to realize that it is time to do the work. They all say it. They all mean it. It is is the pattern that is repeating itself over and over again, everywhere. I’m tired of looking at it from the distance, not realizing that I’ve got to do the work also. I also have to show up for myself, for my family, for all of those that will be part of this thing. For all the ones that will come next. I won’t be the main engineer of Space X, or developing the ultimate artificial intelligence for Tesla. Nope, that is not my thing. My thing is to help those incredible humans polish their mind as much as they can so that they can come up with the most amazing ideas. Each of the persons that is going to be part of the cohort can come with an idea, with something that they are working on, and the other guys will have to create together a solution for that thing. That is the whole game. The ultimate creativity, building something for each other, to help each other in their own game. That is what the internet is about, and it is important to realize the different personalities that every human being has so that something can be built having that in mind. Each person has something to add to the other, and in the opening to that possibility there is amazing wealth to be built.\n\n    That is the game that is being played in here, by deepening the relationship that each person has with itself. We need to be more creative than ever, and the only way in is through. The only way into that creativity is by exploring deeper and deeper into who each human being is, so that the connection with the source can be established more clearly. With less interference. That is where the magic comes from, from that connection. From touching the alchemical gold and being transformed through that process. By showing up and building a space for people to do that, things will change. We will go through that together. In the Samadhi Center retreat, we had 2 periods of 2 hours of meditation. In this transformational journey, we will have 2 periods of 2 hours of deep creative work, from which our true nature will arise. How do you define deep creative work? That is a very good question, and it is ought to be explored in the future as this project gets more complex. The important thing now is to build cohort 1, which will be the one that will set up the tone for the whole thing. Which is the one that will start building the internet of the future, the way on which we relate to us and each other together. Something amazing will come up from here. It doesn’t matter if we are the only ones, we will be there pushing it forward. Exploring what happens from there. Life is an invitation into a constant iteration into what works and what doesn’t, that is how we learn. That is how nature evolves. Trial and error. Trial and error. We are here for that. That is where the fun is. Do The Work, makes mistakes and digest what happened so that you can evolve from there. There are no failures, only misinterpretations of what was valuable in the experience that you went through. It is all about perspective. Everything boils down to perspective. Realize that and be free of wanting things to be different from what they are. They are what they should be, they are as they should be, and they have always been. That is the magic of this whole thing, that each of us has at hand the means for dong their best. The means for realizing that everything is at its hand.\n\nAnd I am the first one that needs to realize that, because I’m in charge of this project. It is my duty to build it as cool as I can, and if I keep pushing me down for not being enough I won’t end up anywhere. What do I need to have the trust in myself that is needed to use down? The understanding that resistance will always ne there. That’s what this guy speaks about in the book The War On Art. Steven Pressfield. He speaks about the restistance as that mighty enemy that won’t let you be free. It will never let you be free, so you’ve got to learn how to deal with it. It is part of being a human being. So the thing is to move forward with it and enjoy the ride. It is to push through that resistance and overcome it by just sitting own and do the work. Which is the important work that I’m doing right now? Just showing up and writing this. Trusting that it will bring about what I need so that I can evolve in this amazing world that we live in. Everything that I need is already here, I just need to trust it enough. Surrender and trust are about showing up and doing the work, and letting life do its thing. And its thing is whatever happens next, the important thing is to have the perspective in place so that I don’t feel that there is something against me. There is nothing against me. There I only a collection of experiences that is going on and is part of it, it will always be part of it, no matter what happens, so what I can do is just accept it as part of reality and move on from there. With trust. With love. The important thing is to do the work so that day after day I’m better able to love myself a little bit more. Only a little, that is all what is needed. Step by step. And there will be hard days, this thing is not easy. But always remember the resistance, and how it will always conspire agains our creative self because it wants to be sfe. And creating stuff is not safe, because you are exposing yourself. You are showing to the world what you are, everything that you are, and it can be brutal. It is crazy not to have walls built around your experience. It is crazy to be open. We are not used to it, but it is what it is. It is what needs to happen for us to evolve. Everything must be open, available, so that we can evolve from there. It is time to be transparent, as a wall of glass, so that the light can shine from deep within.\n\n    My mission is to be there for all of those who are lost. For all of those who don’t see the way out. For all of those that are depressed and haven’t found help anywhere. For those who have realized by the use of psychedelics that there is a world within that they did not know it existed, and that want to go deeper into the exploration of that world. My mission is to kindle a light into the soul of this people, so that they can feel that they are not alone. This universe that is being built is a beehive on which each of us will be the bees that will bring the nectar of the soul into our queen, our beloved mother. It doesn’t matter if you hate your mother, there is an aspect within yourself that craves for connection to her, to the feminine, to Mother Earth. Call it as you wish, but that will be our queen in this beehive. And each of us will go and tap to the infinite source by Doing The Work. By being part of this collective, you will realize that you are not alone. Not by talking nonsense that will never get you anywhere as the best diet, or the best practices to get better sleep, or whatever. The mission of Dukkha is to help you realize that that information is already there, and you don’t need it in here. What you need is a place to connect with yourself, through the connection with others, and with that, be able to have better relationship with all of those aspects of your life that you want to put energy in. The less time you spend in the discord server, the better, because an important part of Doing The Work is realizing that The Work is done everywhere, all at once. In wherever situation you are in, there will always be an opportunity to do the work. So we come here and develop this intensive program so that we can better understand what we need to do to do the work, but it is nothing more than that. We practice the practices here within Dukkha so that the fog is lifted, so that we can go to our life without that fog and share with every situation all of who we are, all of who we have always been. Each 21 program will teach you how to lift up the fog. How to stay present. It will give you different tools for developing a relationship with yourself that will enable you to give your best in every situation. And then you will come back here to do it again. This is an ongoing process, and what is going to happen in each journey is just the starting point of it. What comes next is the work that you will do in every aspect of your life to recognize how that aspect is helping you to become more fogged, and then being able to recognize that you will get into the realization on how you need to act so that fog is not up again. It is an ongoing process of being a witness to the fog, and realizing that the fog is not you. You are what is behind the fog, what has always been there. No matter if your eyes are open or close, you are always there. That is the key realization, which will bring you to a state of non resistance, of flowing with things just as how they are. This non resistance will open up the avenues for your true self to express itself through every one of your actions, and this is what lifting the fog is all about. Realizing that you are much more than the fog, than those constant, pathological thoughts, and letting your creative genius free That is all what you need to evolve, to bring about your best work. TO shine. Lift the fog and you will shine. The sun is not reaching your inside because of the fog. Start being aware of your breathing and lift it up. It will feel amazing. It will feel more you the n ever. That is the cool part. Doing The Work feels amazing. It is a sensation of freedom that connects you with the core of your existence, and that is something that is foreign to you if you haven’t experienced before. If you hadn’t open that window before. But it is not about you, most of us have not been able to open that window, and that is why we are here, to help each other to become free of the window. To travel into another aspect of the being, which is based on a pure connection with all what is. Not what has been, or what will be, but just with what is. And that is the cool part about this thing, that there is nothing more here than what already is here, so there is actually nothing o be changed, more than your tendency for wanting things to be different. That is the only problem. Our lack of acceptance of how things truly are. As soon as you become free of that wanting to control that part of your life, the rest will take care of itself alone. It willl start resonating in a differen way, you will start resonating in a different way, and from there on there is no way back. It will be scary, it is fucking scary for me, right now as I write I feel very weird movements of energy throughout my body, mainly in weird areas of my brain, but I know tat I just need to push through it. To trust and know that everything will babe ok. But there is my primordial heart of ceasing to exist, of forgetting who I am, of learning my family behindnd. I know that all this fear is coming from the mind but, who am I? What is the mind? Are these words being written by the mind of by me? That is the question that goes through my mind a lot, and nob writing it down is an exploration into th answer by just pointing a torch into that aspect of myself that is always questioning and wanting to know. The mind wants to know. My mind wants to know it all. I want to indulge deeply into every conversation that Lex Fridman has had with the most amazing humans run the world, so that I can know more about this amazing experience called life. But I fucking can’t. It is impossible, at least now, so it is time to make peace with that fact and move on. I kind of feel that I have been able to make peace with that fact, but I’m not sure yet because it is coming up now. I guess that part of that existential fear is related to not being able to do everything that I would like in my lifetime. Being more with my family, writing more, reading more, listening to more music, more, more, more. Everything is more. Why do we always want more, and not less? When is the moment that the shift is made when the realization that comes is that less is more? That sounds unbelievably valuable, specially in this day and age. Less is more, believe it until the core of your being. If you want to indulge all day long into different content, have in mind than the biggest investment that you can do in your lifetime is realizing that less is more. Wisdom and happiness are in another place. Open your eyes.\n\nWho am I talking to? I have realized that most of the time I’m talking to myself, because I realize that huge part of me that wants this to be over. That wants the seeking to be over. That’s why I talk to myself, because I know that someday someone will find value on reading all the struggle that I have gone through inside my own mind. You are not the only one, my friend, there are plenty of us that have gone through this whole process. You are not the only one. It is a natural part of being alive, it is the journey that we sign up for as we jump into the experience of becoming. And it is the mystery also. The magic. The way ahead. I’m paving the road for you to walk it afterwards. Or maybe paving is not the best analogy, maybe I’m just cutting through the noise with my machete. Cutting through all the noise of the mind, bringing it all out so that what remains is just stillness. Not more noise. Only stillness. The only way in is through, and I’m opening the path so that for you it is easier to go through. Establishing an environment through which you can walk and with that evolve into what you came here to be. And have always been. Opening the bushes, shattering the noise into thin air so that clarity can come forth. That is what is needed. The clarity of the pond not being moving because of incessant thoughts. The clarity that comes when there are no more thoughts, the clarity that comes when everything stops and time ceases to exist. That is what shows up when time ceases to exist. The timeless. The open void of non-movement. What remains when there is no more movement? Only you, but without the you. Just pure awareness. That which has always been bringing in reality through each of your senses.\n\nEach sense of your body is a window into the world, an interface towards it, and it can’t be shut down. What can be shut down is your identification with that interface, so that you can realize that you are way beyond that. Closer than close. If I open my eyes, awareness is there, receiving what comes in from the senses. If I close my eyes, awareness is still there, receiving something different because the input signal is different. But it is still there. What does remain behind that? I always tend that awakening is ‘viewing’ in a different way, always associated with sight in any way. But there is a fundamental shift that will take place when I realize that awakening is not related to the sense of sight, nor it is related to the sense of hearing, or touching, or tasting, or smelling. It is beyond each of these inputs, it is beyond what theis interface brings into it. Each sense of the human body is just an input in the computer, but: What is behind the computer? Which is the operative system of this computer? I don’t even understand if that is a proper analogy, but I just say it to find any meaning in there to get a finer grasp of this thing. To be better able to explain it. But how can I explain it if I don’t really know what I’m talking about? What is going on in here? Just pure noise, the mind makings its appearance and trying to grasp into something to swhich it can’t really grasp, building up concepts and ways of explaining that which can’t be explained. Which is the goal of that? Continue with the game of division, of separation, from which it feeds itself. The mind is a machine that is fed by this game of separation, and as soon as I’m able to realize that more clearly I will move towards a better iuundefstanding of what it means to be free. I just want to be free. I want to break free. When I say that, who is the ‘I’ that is writing it? Who is the one that wants to break free? Is it the ego that is highly spiritualized and that wants to become something? Is it the mind that continues to believe that the way on which it will realize its true nature is by realizing that it is just a concept that does not have any solid existence? This whole game is a maze, and I’m deeply into the mazer, not really knowing how to get out. I guess that all these words are like the small crumbles of bread that I’m throwing at the floor as I go deeper and deeper into the maze,so that I can get out afterwards without becoming crazy. All these words are the means by which I help myself to get out after I realize that there is nothing that can be understood. I know that in a conceptual level, but a big part of me wants to know. Is that part getting bigger or smaller as I write these words? Is it becoming stronger or weaker? Is it more present or more absent?\n\nI guess that a big gauge that can help answer those questions is what happens after all these writing sessions, as I go back to relate to the people with which I interact in a daily basis and become who I am by relating to them. There is a big feeling inside that there has been a strong evolution in that relationship, as I open more and more to accepting them for who they are. I go to my parents house and I’m more able to see them for who they are, realizing that they are not the patterns of action that trigger me, they are way beyond that. I go to my grandmothers house and open to the possibility of knowing her for who she is, more than what I want her to be. That is something that is becoming more present day after day: I’m starting to give up the control of wanting people to be different. Even myself. Sometimes I see myself doing things that make me judge me afterwards, and then I realize that it is all a game. It is all the game of the mind, trying to make sense of something that can’t be made sense. And then comes the freedom from that, and a good laughter. A cosmic laughter, that comes from the cosmic joke. The joke of the mental universe, on which I’m always trying to make sense. Always wanting to know. The mind wants to know. I’m the perfect example of that. Perhaps we are all the best example of that, it is just that I have played the game so deeply that I’m very aware about it. And it gets hilarious. The games that the mind play are hilarious. It is time to realize that I’m not those games, and just have fun playing them. Release the inner child that has been with me all my life, and be free from wanting to be someone. Be able to be. Be able to witness who I am with all my deficiencies and just enjoy. With the complexities of what the mind has built, of this whole maze that I have built for myself.\n\nImagine, instead of being just a normal dude working some wood and having a chilled experience, I’m doing my best to build up this DAO (whatever a DAO is) and connect people from all over the world with the intention to awaken the human race. Why couldn’t I be just a normal dude that want’s to do his thing in silence? I can’t. There is a deep need in me related to complexity, to bringing up something more than what is there. And I can’t rest on the feeling of not trying my best to do it. Maybe the next lifetime I will be able to rest a bit more. I don’t know. But for now, it is time to buidl, to create something cool, and to transform the world into something different. I will do my best to understand that there is no need to transform anything, but I do want to help in some way, it is my nature. What I will try to do is not become identified with the consequences of that transformation, but I will try to do something cool. I’m already doing it. It is part of who I am. And it is fun. It will be fun to come back to these writings some day and realize how weird and crazy I was. What the fuck was going on in that mind in that moment. I’m going through the most transformational process of my whole existence, that is what is going on. My daughter is becoming 1 year old in a few days and I feel that there is something that is being unleashed inside me that I can’t understand. But I won’t fight it. It is not worth fighting. What is worth is observing and being grateful for everything that is. For all of what this lifetime has given me. The amazing family that I have, the amazing life experience.\n\nYesterday my mother was telling me about those times on which she was young, and all what was going on inside and around her. She grew up in a farm. And my father grew up in the city. How amazing it is to be able to say that. I have the best of both worlds, and I have not been able to realize it because of this mind constantly making its noise, telling me that I’m behind from where I should be. But it is there, and the only thing that is needed from me is to open my heart and realize everything of what they have to share with me. That is all what is needed. That is the magic. The jungle meets the monastery, the farm meets the city. Everything is merging into something different from everything that we can imagine, and it is time for us to open up the eyes and witness the biggest transformation in human history. Consciousness is waking up to itself, and we are in the front row of that becoming. Of that coming into being.\n\nSo much information out there in the internet, so much going on, and it is time to bring it all together to build something concise that can cut through the noise. It is so easy to get lost in everything that is present. To be lost thinking that A is better than B. This project is about that, it is about exploring different pillars so that the best can be brought up. What is the best really? There is nothing as the best. There is only a perpetual exploration into what is, and the fact that this program is created by the community makes it as powerful as it will be. All of the other programs out there are created by masters and people that have walked the path, but what happens when we are the ones that create the path and hold the space for each other? What comes out of that? This project is an exploration into that. I believe that ‘the best’ is just a way of speaking about what is constantly looking for feedback in order to evolve into something that fulfills its mission in a ever-changing way. What if that feedback is gathered by the community and processed by it? Which are the means that are needed for this feedback to be used in a way that is conducent to something new? Which are the means by which the success of the whole thing will be measured? Is it even necessary to measure something?\n\n· · ·\n\nThe whole point about this thing is to better understand beauty, and how it expresses throughout life. There is a deep aspect within our existence connected to that word, and I guess that this whole exploration into the self and into our true nature is to build a closer bonding towards that word. Towards being able to express beauty in the way on which we relate to ourselves, and from there, to the world. If you are able to relate to yourself in a beautiful way, what will come out from that relationship will bring forth beauty into the expressions that you bring into the world. Each aspect of your being manifests itself in the world through your actions, through every interaction that you go through, and the question that arises is: Why don’t make each interaction a piece of art? I have spoken about every moment being a window into the infinite, into the timeless, into our true self. Why don’t make each moment an exploration into what comes when you are building a piece of art? The thesis is that to exist being in a way different than this demands a higher expenditure of energy, because there is energy that is wasted in the perpetuation of the thought and behavioral patterns that have determined life until this point. As soon as that is freed, there is much more space for stuff to come up from there, and that is where energy starts being available to other processes, and better used. More efficiently. Part of it wasted for running unconscious programs, and that is part of it that is not used for the creative expression of who you are (by definition). Why wouldn’t you do the work of freeing this energy? Because there is a certain momentum that keeps this energy in place and running in the old programs, and setting it free demands a lot of willingness to do it. To Do The Work. And it is unclear what the consequence of Doing it will be, so it is much easier to not do it and stay in the unconscious and conditioned patterns of action. And that is why we perpetuate the way on which ewe do things. An atomic bomb of awareness is required for things to change, and that is where certain practices as breath work, psychedelics or others come in, to help in that process, to shine a light into what is possible so that you can start becoming free of the recursive patterns of action.\n\nI hold the belief that these atomic bombs are needed, because if not it is very hard to realize what is not in place. The mind feels that everything is perfect as it is, and it is unable to realize that there is something that could be waaaay better (and it is very hard to realize this space for betterment(. From the outside it is clear, it is seen, but from the inside the programs are running in circles and getting out of it is very hard. Until there is a collapse, there is a breaking in the system that demand actions, that demands immediate help. That demands a big change in the relationship with the self and the surrounding. Right now, in our society, there are no means for producing that, but there will be more and more, as the tools for discovery of the self get more and more available. And that’s where Dukkha steps in, in the acknowledgment of where we are heading as a society. Psychedelics and breath work will continue to grow in use, there is no doubt about that, but what happens when that door has been opened? Where is that tender hand at the other side that helps people go through the process of **integration** so that they can become what they saw that they could become? The psychedelic assisted therapy is like peeking to the other side of the curtain of what can be possible, and Dukkha’s transformational journeys are the holding of the hand and stepping into the other side with all your potential. Once you have an experience like this, you _know_ that there is something more, and the soul wants to live in there. But it is very easy to come back to old patterns, and from there continue to exists as it has always been. Dukkha will be about helping this people realize a new way of being, with **creativity** as the main focal point of this integration process. Expressing the self through the creation of something new. And on the long term it will be about holding the space for each voyager in this journey. The long term dream is that the person that will go through the journey can take vacation for one month to tap into her true potential, and that month can be paid by other person that just wants the betterment of society. What I have in my soul is the creation of a reciprocal system of payments that enable the cycle to keep on going, Vipassana style. Goenka had a huge fortune that enabled him to create all these physical centers on which to create these retreats, but the retreats that Dukkha will create are more about bringing spirituality into every aspect of life, by integrating the practice into daily life. That’s why it is about 21 days of Doing The Work, because that is the time that science has demonstrated as needed for developing a new habit. It will be about 21 days of building that habit, and realizing the impact that it will have in the life of every person that is part of it. Together. In community.\n\nEach participant of Dukkha’s transformational journeys will come at the other side with a unique approach into her own creative capacity, and that will be extremely powerful in the future of the workforce. Creatives are the ones that are in charge of building the future, and as long as each of us are able to connect to the source in a more direct way we will thrive as a species. I envision people from all walks of life being part of this system, of these journeys, and I envision this 21 days being deeply transformative for all of them. And with the help of all of those who have been part, we’ll keep iterating it, over and over, becoming every day something different, outside of the domain of polarities. It won’t become better or worse, it’ll just become every day. Why have it inside the domain of polarities, that is just what we are trying to avoid in here. This thing is an exploration into what is at the other side of polarities, we are playing with the whole idea of tapping into the non-dual as individuals so that then we can bring that into the way on which we do things (and into what we do). It will be beneficial for the whole project to not talk about polarities, so it is going to be interesting to recognize how duality is expressed in every moment of life, so that you can start making it conscious and with that, using it in a responsible way.\n\nFor example, the first one that comes to mind is the mighty: How are you? That we are soooooo used to ask as we encounter another person. That is the first filler that comes always. So our interaction starts with a polarizing question, and the answer is almost always good. There is almost never a moment to realize how you truly are, to inquiry into the inside and realize truly what is going on in there. How would our relationships look like if we had a commandment from god to wait three seconds to answer that question? What would start coming up? What do we hold inside in the constant answering of ‘I’m good’? What are we suppressing by always answering the same thing? Why do we need to start conversations like that? Is it because of a lack of trust I ourselves? Or what? If I had to choose one of the things that most call my attention in my life right now, it would be this aspect of the interaction between humans. How present this question is, and how shallow it is. And how deep it could be, if we just opened to the truth. This is where the truth comes back, because once you start approaching life in the quest of finding the truth, there is no way back. It follows you, wherever you go, whatever you do. If you answer to that question with the all pervading ‘I’m good, how about you?’, there will always be a voice inside your head telling you: ‘Are you sure that you are feeling good? What is that pressure that you are feeling inside your chest? What is that pressure telling you about how you truly are?’. And there it goes. You won’t get rid of that voice unless you are truthful with your interactions, and as soon as you realize that, and how good it feels to be truthful with your interactions, it is something that you can’t stop. So this whole game of which I’m establishing the guidelines here is an exploration into what it is to be truth. In everything you do. The truth will set you free. The truth will set free the life force that is buried inside every cell of your body, so that it can be used in service of a purpose bigger than yourself. Because you are bigger than yourself, you just haven’t been able to recognize it yet. But you will. We will all do it, with the help of each other, walking next to each other, helping each other navigate it through the paved road. Through the open jungle. Through the skies without fog. Open your eyes and walk through. The only way in is through. Come on in. It feels good in here. It feels true.\n\n· · ·\n\nSurrender to what is, to what has always been, and let life flow through each one of your cells. Open up to the possibility of being a witness of how creation unfolds. Don’t try to control it, you can’t. The more you resist it, the less enjoyable it becomes. Don’t you want to enjoy? Surrender to what is. That is the way in. That is where the magic lies. How to surrender? Just practice. Use each moment as a window that life is giving you as an opportunity to practice a little bit more. Use each breath as an invitation to let go. To be free of controlling. To just be. Learn to just be. But forget the learning part. Just be. Every moment that you realize that you are trying to do something, forger the trying. Just do it. Every moment that you remember that you are breathing, forget the remembering. Just breathe. You will realize that this is the practice, and that each moment is an exploration to deepen the capacity for going within. It is not easy, it s a journey that demands very big amounts of effort, but it will be the most rewarding journey of your life. It is the only journey that you need to take. The journey within. Everything else is just the mind trying to survive, to make its shining appearance. Integrate that, be grateful for it, and just move on. Just being. Doing The Work.\n",

To bring about the truth of your being into your awareness, so that from there you can be free. And a big element of the human experience that is present right now for me is the capacity, or the tendency, or whatever it is for us to not trust in ourselves enough so that we can share our voice, the unique thing that we bring. It is so easy to hide ourselves behind the willingness to do something good, but not be able to open up to share it because your truth feels weird It doesn\\u2019t feel what people have been used to hear from you, so it feels weird to do it. It is always that voice inside the head that is telling yo that the work is not good enough, that you are not worthy of attention from those who want to listen. And this game of awakening is waking up to that truth also, to the truth that it doesn\\u2019t really matter, because the creative process itself is not dependent on what people think directly. You do your thing, and then you share it. There may be an aspect of feedback that transforms what you are doing as you are doing it (I\\u2019m taking right now about a musician on stage that decides to do something different because of the crowd giving some particular feedback about it), but in that case, the feedback is being used constructively for the artist to evolve what she is doing. It is food for the creation that is taking oplace, not something that pushes it down. And that is where I\\u2019m trying to get at here, that food for creation can be sometimes constructive or descrutctive, depending on the way on which the artist receives it. And the more connected you are to the source, the less damage this feedback does to you in a destructive way, because you create from a place different than that which worries about people not being happy with what you do. That is part of the game of awakening the truth, to your truth\\u2026.

That is the question that should be asked. Who is the receptor of your creation? What comes to mind right now is the story about Vincent Van Gogh (or a painter like that), who sold just 1 painting throughout his life in the equivalent of 16 euros of now, and then lately died because of a disease without knowing anything about the success that he will have later. But he was true, he was doing his thing for something more than fame or fortune. He was doing it from a deep place of within, which enabled him to have a particular artistic expression that was unique to who he was. Perhaps his unique expression was not related to selling his paintings, or becoming famous in any way, but it is like that, he was able to find means to express it in a different way, and his mark is there. Was he worse because he didn\\u2019t have the recognition of the public, feedback, when he was alive? No, not at all. He created something so unique, so perfectly his, that he was recognized by it afterwards, and his ego did not become attached to what he was creating in the sense that it would if he new that people were paying attention.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"That is something very interesting about this internet age, how in many cases the important thing is the ideas that are behind the person, more than the person itself.

That whole structure of who you have been is that, a construct, which does not need to be in place for this game to be played. At the end, what do you want people to recognize you for? Do you even want to be recognized r you just want to enjoy life? I put the word or in there, as if they were not complementary concepts. Of course you can be recognized and enjoy life, but I have the feeling that there will always be this small aspect of ego that will not leave you alone. And if you create stuff without labelling it with your name there is a particular kind of freedom, that I, myself, as not experienced completely. Maybe it is time to play the game and start building from there, to see what comes up. To explore the game a little bit and realize how fun it can be to have no name. On having no head.

What is the relationship of having no name in social media and publishing from that place and awakening to your true nature? All these things are coming from the mind, there is an eternal need inside there that wants to know, that wants to better understand the consequence of what it does so that it can control better the outcomes. And that is the eternal game of the \\u2018what could happen if\\u2026?\\u2019. There is no way out of that game, because there is a fundamental impossibility of knowing if action is not taken. The only way to know is to take action, is to do the thing. It is to bring it out from the mind and into the world, which is another aspect of mind, but one that is shared. There his the internal aspect of the mind that is the one that goes running and running in circles inside the head, inside myself, and then there is the collective aspect of mind that is where we all are. It is the place where what I do interacts with what you have done and from there both of us evolve in our particular ways into something different that can be completely different from what was happening inside the mind of each of the participants and the movie that was being played inside there. Kopfikno. That is the word. The cinema of the mind. That word has always stuck with me, because it is so true. The mind is always playing a story that s related to its conditioning, to what has gone throughout its life, and from there it is able to try and predict what will happen in the future. We are the best predicting the future, but the worse predictors. Which is the idea of predicting the future? Yes, of course that planning is one of those things, but is it that important to pan? That is something that I wonder a lot, because my father is the best planner of them all. Everything is measured and planned, and it is something that of course has worked for him in his life, but I really wonder if it is something that is condiment to the expression of the soul.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"To the truth.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"How is planning connected to the truth?

So that planning is helpful, because I\\u2019m able to carve out some time to sit down and just be, so that I can better feel how it feels to be, and bring it about in all my other interactions.

I want to share my story beca\\xB4use this is how it feels to be a perpetual seeker, to be involved with Dukkha at the bottom of your toes. There is nothing that is enough, and I want to break free. But I even doubt if this is my ego that wants to evolve spiritually, and then go and create stuff under this ego so that the image that the world has of itself is different and cooler. Do I really want the image of myself to be cooler or this is just an exploration into what I want to create? The good thing about creating this whole thing under the image of a creation that doesn\\u2019t exist in reality (that whole thing is another creation of the mind, because if this character is built through the internet, and it doesn\\u2019t have a human being attached on its name, isn\\u2019t it true? Isn\\u2019t it real? Of course it is real. And of course that it has a human character attached in its back. I will be there, pulling the strings, until there are no boundaries and the strings become me. Until the hands merge with what is being pulled, and from there, stuff starts happening. It is nice to hide behind my face and hide behind the fact that I say that I\\u2019m being truthful with my truth, but is is hard to give up the identification of that truth with me. That is the step that I feel that needs to be taken now, the full dissolving of my identity in the way that I speak about awakening. I need to become free from the attachment of my ego of \\u2018wanting to be awake\\u2019. That\\u2019s what Jed McKenna did with his book. He wrote it from a perspective of someone that is not actually present there, probably because of the consequence that writing that book would have on the perspective on which he saw himself, and other people saw himself also. There is beauty, there is value, on breaking free of the identification with what people think about you, and in creating from that place. Van Gogh created from a place of pure expression, and what remains from him is just his art. Nothing else matters. What he brought to the world is what stays, not who he was particularly. Who he was is translated into everything that he painted, and it that, he freed himself on having to realize who he was, because it was an eternal exploration through what he did. This is similar to just being. You are in the sense the you let yourself be. And the expression of that being ends up being the creation of stuff, just for the sake of it. That\\u2019s all of what I have been talking about today, about the consequences of creating just for the sake of it, without attachments to the consequences of that creation. My mother knitted socks, but those creations are fully conditioned to her ego because the only way on which she shares her work is by giving them out as a present, for free, so that people can use them and tell their friends that she was the one that made them. There is always an attachment there related to someone telling that you were the one that did something. What is that attachment is not related to my persona, but for a secondary character that I create in the world and who is in charge of doing something cool out there? I have been sharing consistently through Instagram this week breath work sessions, but it is getting to a point where I don\\u2019t know if it is helping me anymore. Of course it helps, because there is information that comes from the fact that I\\u2019m able to share my truth with the world, but, do I really need to do it? Is it a step into the transition of opening that is created when you are able to share your truth without wanting to change other people? That is part of my intention while doing what I\\u2019m doing there. Explore into the sensations that come. Share my truth. Share everything that I am now, so that people can better understand the point where I am at. Is it necessary? I feel it as doing the due diligence for people to better get me. Do I need to do it? The easier way would be to create for me an account not associated to my name, and create for there. Is that the way forward?

Trying to fit is acknowledging that there is something in you that wants to be expressed but not having the guts to do it. Trying to fit is spending the precious life force that you have inside in the game of other different than yourself and the people with which you relate.

By showing up and building a space for people to do that, things will change. We will go through that together. In the Samadhi Center retreat, we had 2 periods of 2 hours of meditation.

So we come here and develop this intensive program so that we can better understand what we need to do to do the work, but it is nothing more than that. We practice the practices here within Dukkha so that the fog is lifted, so that we can go to our life without that fog and share with every situation all of who we are, all of who we have always been. Each 21 program will teach you how to lift up the fog. How to stay present. It will give you different tools for developing a relationship with yourself that will enable you to give your best in every situation. And then you will come back here to do it again. This is an ongoing process, and what is going to happen in each journey is just the starting point of it. What comes next is the work that you will do in every aspect of your life to recognize how that aspect is helping you to become more fogged, and then being able to recognize that you will get into the realization on how you need to act so that fog is not up again. It is an ongoing process of being a witness to the fog, and realizing that the fog is not you. You are what is behind the fog, what has always been there. No matter if your eyes are open or close, you are always there. That is the key realization, which will bring you to a state of non resistance, of flowing with things just as how they are. This non resistance will open up the avenues for your true self to express itself through every one of your actions, and this is what lifting the fog is all about. Realizing that you are much more than the fog, than those constant, pathological thoughts, and letting your creative genius free That is all what you need to evolve, to bring about your best work.

When is the moment that the shift is made when the realization that comes is that less is more? That sounds unbelievably valuable, specially in this day and age.

I go to my parents house and I\\u2019m more able to see them for who they are, realizing that they are not the patterns of action that trigger me, they are way beyond that. I go to my grandmothers house and open to the possibility of knowing her for who she is, more than what I want her to be. That is something that is becoming more present day after day: I\\u2019m starting to give up the control of wanting people to be different. Even myself. Sometimes I see myself doing things that make me judge me afterwards, and then I realize that it is all a game. It is all the game of the mind, trying to make sense of something that can\\u2019t be made sense. And then comes the freedom from that, and a good laughter. A cosmic laughter, that comes from the cosmic joke. The joke of the mental universe, on which I\\u2019m always trying to make sense. Always wanting to know. The mind wants to know.

The games that the mind play are hilarious. It is time to realize that I\\u2019m not those games, and just have fun playing them. Release the inner child that has been with me all my life, and be free from wanting to be someone. Be able to be. Be able to witness who I am with all my deficiencies and just enjoy.

There is a deep aspect within our existence connected to that word, and I guess that this whole exploration into the self and into our true nature is to build a closer bonding towards that word. Towards being able to express beauty in the way on which we relate to ourselves, and from there, to the world. If you are able to relate to yourself in a beautiful way, what will come out from that relationship will bring forth beauty into the expressions that you bring into the world. Each aspect of your being manifests itself in the world through your actions, through every interaction that you go through, and the question that arises is: Why don\\u2019t make each interaction a piece of art? I have spoken about every moment being a window into the infinite, into the timeless, into our true self. Why don\\u2019t make each moment an exploration into what comes when you are building a piece of art? The thesis is that to exist being in a way different than this demands a higher expenditure of energy, because there is energy that is wasted in the perpetuation of the thought and behavioral patterns that have determined life until this point. As soon as that is freed, there is much more space for stuff to come up from there, and that is where energy starts being available to other processes, and better used. More efficiently. Part of it wasted for running unconscious programs, and that is part of it that is not used for the creative expression of who you are (by definition). Why wouldn\\u2019t you do the work of freeing this energy? Because there is a certain momentum that keeps this energy in place and running in the old programs, and setting it free demands a lot of willingness to do it. To Do The Work. And it is unclear what the consequence of Doing it will be, so it is much easier to not do it and stay in the unconscious and conditioned patterns of action. And that is why we perpetuate the way on which ewe do things. An atomic bomb of awareness is required for things to change, and that is where certain practices as breath work, psychedelics or others come in, to help in that process, to shine a light into what is possible so that you can start becoming free of the recursive patterns of action.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[\"I hold the belief that these atomic bombs are needed, because if not it is very hard to realize what is not in place.

From the outside it is clear, it is seen, but from the inside the programs are running in circles and getting out of it is very hard. Until there is a collapse, there is a breaking in the system that demand actions, that demands immediate help. That demands a big change in the relationship with the self and the surrounding. Right now, in our society, there are no means for producing that, but there will be more and more, as the tools for discovery of the self get more and more available. And that\\u2019s where Dukkha steps in, in the acknowledgment of where we are heading as a society.

What I have in my soul is the creation of a reciprocal system of payments that enable the cycle to keep on going, Vipassana style. Goenka had a huge fortune that enabled him to create all these physical centers on which to create these retreats, but the retreats that Dukkha will create are more about bringing spirituality into every aspect of life, by integrating the practice into daily life. That\\u2019s why it is about 21 days of Doing The Work, because that is the time that science has demonstrated as needed for developing a new habit.

This thing is an exploration into what is at the other side of polarities, we are playing with the whole idea of tapping into the non-dual as individuals so that then we can bring that into the way on which we do things (and into what we do).

That we are soooooo used to ask as we encounter another person. That is the first filler that comes always. So our interaction starts with a polarizing question, and the answer is almost always good. There is almost never a moment to realize how you truly are, to inquiry into the inside and realize truly what is going on in there. How would our relationships look like if we had a commandment from god to wait three seconds to answer that question? What would start coming up? What do we hold inside in the constant answering of \\u2018I\\u2019m good\\u2019? What are we suppressing by always answering the same thing? Why do we need to start conversations like that? Is it because of a lack of trust I ourselves? Or what? If I had to choose one of the things that most call my attention in my life right now, it would be this aspect of the interaction between humans. How present this question is, and how shallow it is. And how deep it could be, if we just opened to the truth. This is where the truth comes back, because once you start approaching life in the quest of finding the truth, there is no way back. It follows you, wherever you go, whatever you do. If you answer to that question with the all pervading \\u2018I\\u2019m good, how about you?\\u2019, there will always be a voice inside your head telling you: \\u2018Are you sure that you are feeling good? What is that pressure that you are feeling inside your chest? What is that pressure telling you about how you truly are?\\u2019. And there it goes. You won\\u2019t get rid of that voice unless you are truthful with your interactions, and as soon as you realize that, and how good it feels to be truthful with your interactions, it is something that you can\\u2019t stop. So this whole game of which I\\u2019m establishing the guidelines here is an exploration into what it is to be truth. In everything you do. The truth will set you free. The truth will set free the life force that is buried inside every cell of your body, so that it can be used in service of a purpose bigger than yourself.

          "raw": "\nThis book is about Doing The Work. It is a testament that I want to bring into existence as a consequence of having done it myself. It is brutal. I just ended my morning meditation after waking up at 4:44 am, meditating for 1 hour which was eternal because very tough stuff is coming up during it and it makes it hard to go through, and no one is there for telling me ‘congratulations, you did it again’. In this world we are used to getting feedback from it, which makes us feel good. We are used to receive praise, or any kind of external consequence for what we do, but in this kind of game there won’t be something like that. You have to show up for yourself, and it can get quite challenging not to have that external validation. If you don’t validate it internally, how can you keep it up? I guess that my take on that is that this is the point where faith comes in. And maybe faith is another way to speak about that internal fire which moves us towards the unknown. There is something within me that is craving for the exploration of the unknown, there is part of me that _knows_, and that is the part that doesn’t need external reassurance, because it is everything that is. The part of me that calls for The Work is the consequence of it. That part helps me do it, because it knows that the consequence of it is fundamentally different from whatever external validation I could get in 48 lifetimes. There is a knowledge within, which pursues this thing and helps me go through it without needing someone to be next to me telling me: ‘You are doing it right boy, keep it going’. At the end of the day we are alone in this thing, and no one can do The Work for you. That is what you signed up for when you started reading this thing. Just sit. Just sit and ask yourself ‘Who am I?’ Until there is no one asking. Just do The Work.\n\nDukkha is being created to join forces in this quest. I do it on my own because I’m alone, I don’t know enough people, nor have a proper job, on which I can do this kind of thing and be alongside with other people that are aiming to do it. A big part of me wants to belong, to be part of a collective of human beings that are aiming towards the same thing, that are seekers who know the thing and are willing to annihilate themselves in order to experience the truth. I was sitting down and one of the rants on which my mind went today was: ‘So here I am, learning how to die before I die, on my own house, and no one really knows I’m doing this. No one really understands what I’m going through. I can have a major breakthrough in my meditation, something that can transform the way on which I relate to reality, and my wife and baby will wake up the same as every other day, with the same smile, as if it was all how it has been always’. It’s tough to reconcile that. A big part of me wants them to know, wants them to realize how hard I have worked to become a more conscious, loving and clear human being. But the sole fact that I wrote that sentence is part of the root of the thing, because on that trying hard I get lost in it, forgetting to just be.\nI say ‘I have worked hard to become…’ and that is the whole thing that summarizes what I will talk in this book. The thing is aiming to become. Trying to change something that is already there, and will always be there. I can’t become anything, I’m already it, but I’m not able to realize it because of this eternal wanting, trying, aiming to become. I’m always standing in a point and looking to other one, because I feel deeply inside that there is something that needs to be changed. And that won’t let me live in the present, and that won’t let me truly appreciate every moment that goes by.\n\nEverything that I do is for myself, and writing it down here is a means for establishing it as a testament deep within myself. Everything that I do is for myself, because I am the one that wants to know the truth, and experience life from there. I am the one that is tired of suffering because of Dukkha, and it is on me. I am the one that is willing to Do The Work, to pave the road, because I know. If I do it and then everyone feels the same, that is a window to rejoice in the fact that I do it for me. For me to have a clearer perception of who they are, and enjoy every aspect of their being because of that. It is for me, for having a deeper enjoyment of life. I do it for me, and its not fair for anyone that I think of her different because she hasn’t done it. I do it for me, because I am the one that wants to experience the truth. I do it for me, because I am the one that wants to feel the deepest love that has ever been felt. I do it for me, because I care. Because I love life so much that I want to learn how to let it go. How to break free from the attachments from it. Because this is the most important Work that can be done in a lifetime, and it is time to wake up. It is time to realize the true nature of my being, and for that, no one will be there cheering me up, pushing my ass till the top of the hill. Nope, this is a game that is played by oneself alone, it is a quest on which each of us embarks only with the image that comes back from the mirror. No partners here, I’m so sorry. No one to assess you progress more than you, I’m so sorry. Just you and the look in your eyes. Just you and the consequence of each one of your senses inside you. Just you and your memories, and each conditioning that is part of _your_ particular existence. No one can be in your shoes. Never.\n\nYou can spend a whole lifetime trying to explain who you are, who you have been, what do you want to become, but you will never be able to convey it clearer than just by being. That is everything that you are, and it shows up when you are just being. That is the amazing part of this whole game… The more you understand, the more you have to give up doing something particular. Becoming absolutely free is understanding on a experiential level that there is nothing to be done. We are here just to be. We came just to be. You are the only one that knows. You are the shadow that has been following you the whole time. No one can acknowledge that for you. You have to realize it for yourself. You are the one that will wake up. Not me. I can’t do it for you. And the best way on which I can embody everything that I have learned or experienced is by evolving the way on which I relate to the world. Evolving who I am, just by being the way I am. Just expressing from that place of truth. Of my truth. Every one of us has its own truth, and it is time to fully live that reality. Fully accept it. The other day there was an old person waiting for the bus and we took him to the town, and he started talking to us about how god had changed his life, after presenting himself to this person on a turning point of his life, after being a deep alcoholic for 15 years. That moment absolutely changed his life, and he was talking to us about his relationship with god and all what it meant in his life. Every second of his existence was devoted to god. How can I bring my truth into this story and try to change in any way his perception so that he can understand that he IS god. It is not my job, not my duty, and it is perfect as it is. It is perfect. Every deviation from that perfection is a construct of my ego trying to help people when they don’t need help.\n\nThat is such a constant one, wanting to help when I have not been asked to. It is another expression of what I was talking before, because it is the means by which I impose my truth in front of other person’s truth. I think that mine is more true because I have ‘Done The Work’. How qualified am I to say that my work is more important than the one that all the rest of humans have done? I’m no one. It is not something good to do, and here I am acknowledging that and making a little bit more conscious so that I can better understand why, and bring it into the conscious aspect of my being. Because this is a big one. When I was traveling the world, I used to to different places, with different languages, and the first thing that I asked locals how to say in their language was ‘Do you need help?’. That is me, always willing to help. But which is the limit to that? When does it become something that is not helpful because I’m trying to express an unconscious belief that they need my help because they haven’t done The Work?\n\nThat is a great thing about social media right now, the cat that I can post my work openly, and with that, not have to talk directly to one person, and try to change that particular person. No, now I can share it for all of those who want to listen, and not try to change someone particular. Offer the possibility for change to happen, but just for those that want it and will approach. That is an amazing thing of this day and age, being able to do that. I guess it is my responsibility to build up my audience and the people with which I want to work with, because those are the ones that will give me energy and make me feel alive. It is easy for me to underestimate the power that twitter followers can have, but it is major. It is something that is beyond what I think. And it is my duty to be able to share my voice with those that want to listen, and that’s what I’m doing every day by coming here and just sharing it. And going to twitter and just sharing my thoughts. It is an amazing part of Doing The Work, sharing your stuff openly, and realize that the world doesn’t end if it good enough. It is so easy to under appreciate the work that has been done to reach this understanding, but it doesn’t really matter. What only matters is the work itself, each time that is being done.\n\nToday I have my first breathwork session, actually the first online session that I have planed and that I have charged for, and it is a major day in my life. Most of it it has been very hard for me to establish a healthy relationship with money, most of it lately in my life, because of two things:\n\n1. I have been given a lot of wealth because of having been born where I was born.\n2. It is very hard for me to value what I do enough so that I can charge for it.\n\nSo today is a day on which that transitions into something new, because I open up to the possibility of sharing myself with the world. I have been doing it lately, having a different personality in every social media thing, and it is so amazing, I feel so happy and inspired by being that chamaleon that does something different in each one of them. I feel good with it, and creating this breathwork salon today is an expression of that also. I’m giving myself the space for being there for other people. I was just going to write that I was going to help them, but that is not true. I will just hold the space, and they will help themselves, each on her on way. As I said before, the most important part of this whole game is showing up, and this people will do it. Each of the persons that will be part of this thing will show up, and that is the most important aspect of Doing The Work. Showing up. The saying goes: ‘The most important way on which you can help yourself is to learn how to do things when you don’t feel like doing it’. That is the same. The biggest transformations happen when you show up, just because you care. Just because you want to explore what will happen at the other side. Show up. Be there. For you, not for anyone else. You deserve it.\n\n· · ·\n\nWho am I?\n\nThe one that plays the music. The one that feels the music, in the bottom of the flesh. The one that is running the flesh, bringing into life stuff, a lot of stuff in the meantime. I am the clarity that is present when there is not a noise of something that I should be. I’m not what I should be, I am what I am. That’s all. I am the one that is willing to create something new, and see what happens. I am the one that sees off people show up, that realizes if people are willing to show up by creating the space. I am the one that has a hard time sharing his voice, because it doesn’t come across. I am not the one that expects something particular to happen, I am the one that just lets it happen. I am the holding of the space, because I am space itself. How wouldn’t I be able to hold space if I’m space itself! The shivers in my body, the cold that is more present than below the cold shower.\nAll that trying to answer the question who I am rationally. I’m not that. I can only tell what is present right now, and that is a feeling of awkwardness for not having anyone show up in the salon. There is disappointment present, but also a recognition that the work needs to be refined. I have not done my due diligence properly, and I need to level up my game. The way on which I have been communicating is good, I have good ideas and everything, but it is time to level up the game. I need to become unstoppable, and transform all of who I am into value that can be the means by which I do my thing every day. I want to transform the world, and the way into that is understanding how to play the game. The ones that matter understood how to play the game, and it is in that that I will make my way through. I am the one that just wants to play that game, and is learning how to do it.\n\nI am the one that feels melted when no one shows up, and realizes that that is the game that I have been playing. I am the one that is need for putting the feet in the floor, so that I can run truly. I’ll start running. I’m beginning to run, just by showing up to Do The Work. That is all that matters, Doing The Work. Let discipline be the best master. The samurai. Time to get the shit together. From tomorrow, the schedule will be:\n\n8am - video duration - 5min -> Breathing session\n8am -> Live meditation with samadhi center\n9am-13pm -> Deep work writing session\n\nThis will be what happens every day from Sunday to Friday, and with this, I will crush it. Consistency is the ruler of success. That is how I win, just by being consistent and learning how to play the game. Learn how to play the game, that is all that takes. The game of life.\n\nThis is who I am when all the doubts are in play. I start making sense, understanding what happened and fixing the stuff so that in the future it won’t happen again. It’s just what it is. I am what is behind all these doubts. I am the one who trusts.\n\nI JUST WANT TO BE A HUMAN BEING, AND EXPERIENCE HOW IT FEELS.\n",

I guess that my take on that is that this is the point where faith comes in. And maybe faith is another way to speak about that internal fire which moves us towards the unknown.

There is a knowledge within, which pursues this thing and helps me go through it without needing someone to be next to me telling me: \\u2018You are doing it right boy, keep it going\\u2019. At the end of the day we are alone in this thing, and no one can do The Work for you. That is what you signed up for when you started reading this thing. Just sit.

          "raw": "\nToday I’ll start talking about holding space, and the learnings that come as a consequence of doing that. Yesterday I had a huge one. I organized an event and very few people showed up, which had me very disappointed throughout the whole event because I felt that I had a responsibility with the person that I invited to be the co-host, and the main responsibility that I felt had with her was an economic one. I thought that because of there being very few people, she would get little money, and her time would not be worth it. And there was also the presence of being a failure in the way that I shared what I was going to do, since I was not able to reach out to people properly through social media. But the persons that participated were amazing, they are the most important people for me in the world, and it was very important to share that vulnerable space with them. My wife and the best friend that I have in the world were there. But yes, my capacity for holding the space was compromised because of me having been thrown out of balance for what I felt in that moment. So I was just feeling those sensations and what was brought up for me, through the whole experience. It was important.\n\nAnd then I went to my parents house, and because of a question that my father made to me (‘How many people were there?’) I realized that I have a strong subconscious pattern of thought that is related to the amount of people participating in something equalling how good it is. The more, the better. This has been present throughout my life, as I have had a very large group of friends, have gone to travels with a lot of people, always more and more and more. Thinking that more is the key. I sit down to work and I think that the more hours I put in the better, not realizing that there is a subtle aspect that is working that is way beyond this number. Last night I had a conversation with only one friend and it was very important, very profound, very nice. This is what matters, having this type of interaction. It doesn’t matter with how many people. But it was there, working its way, and yesterday I was able to spot it right on. It was absolutely freeing to be the witness of that process, of that unconscious process. That is what all this game is about, of making the unconscious aspects conscious. And that was a big one. I was able to realize that and become free of it. I don’t mean that it won’t be active and I won’t value my life based on numbers anymore, but at least it is not as present as it was before. And I want to hold space. I want to be there for others. And if I’m there holding the space being disappointed because no more people showed up, I won’t be able to do it fully, with all of what I am. And I want to be able to do it fully. So that’s why it is so important to have realized this, because it will happen again. There will be another time on which I will organize stuff and people will not show up. It has happened, and it will happen.\n\nAnd in that moment, what will I decide? To give my best for those who are there, or to blame myself for not having more people in?\nThe answer is clear as water today. And that is what showing up is for. I created this space, I organized something new, that didn’t exist before, and I showed up for it. I did it because I care. And life answered back with one of the most important realizations that I have had lately, because this is one that constitutes the way on which I work as a human being in society. There is the important concept of traction, and it is impossible to be hosting an event for 100 people from scratch. It is not necessary. What is necessary is to forget about the number, and make it a memorable experience for all of those who are there. For all of those that did show up. My time, their time, is so valuable that it is not worth it to spend it thinking about what could have happened if more people showed up. No, no, no. It is absolutely worth spending with the people that are there, giving their best, pushing it through.\n\nIt is more than ever with this type of work, which requires a compromise from the people that participate. It is not easy. It is not free. You have to Do The Work. And people don’t like to be challenged, not too much. It is tough. So this thing will happen again, and it is going to be very important to be able to realize how the ego is playing his thing, how it is working in those subtle ways so that I can become present with what is in that moment. That is the energy that needs to be moving, and that is the work that I’m going to do as I move towards the understanding of how to truly hold space for the transformation of others. I need to open up to do more things like this. I need to be there for more people as they transition into a new way of being. And it starts here. It starts in every session that I go through, in every moment that I decide to show up for other people. There is a strong need inside me of what it means to hold space, and to take that absolutely seriously, having in mind all the aspects of what it can be. It is not a trivial thing, it is not something that should be taken for granted, and it is important. And the only way to learn how to do it better is just by doing it. Is just by showing up. It is just by creating this stuff and making it happen that life will give this treasures to my journey of discovery of who and what I am.\n\nBecause this way of behaving constitutes me. It is a huge part of me. It is time to integrate it and move forward without it. Because the festival that will be hosted in February as the launching event for the DAO will be the same. It doesn’t matter how many people show up. What matters is the energy of it, and what will happen there. And I’m in charge of that. It will be a retreat of deep work and deep rest. It will be a retreat on which we will transform our beings through the power of sharing with each other, with nature, and with all of what we are. And the only way to do it wholeheartedly is to forget about the caring of how many people will show up. And this is only achieved if there is a true disconnection between the event itself and the capacity of learning money because of how many people show up. That whole thing needs to be disconnected, so that there is no problem in any way if 10 people show up, or 200. What needs to happen is that people have to bring their own stuff, and it has to be everything self-sustaining. Like burning man. Everyone brings their own stuff, we just gather there and see what happens from the experience. But there is not a central authority that is deciding what will happen. I’m just in charge of the music, of finding people that are willing to play their music, or if not, I’m in charge of creating the playlist that will be running if there is no people that is willing to play their music. It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters more than the opportunity to gather to celebrate what is being built through the writing of this document. This is all what is. This is the important part. Because the movement that is starting now is powerful, it will have an impact, and is the energy that is moving through me. I have to be fit for service. I have to be strong. I have to be the best version of myself, and that is not a static thing. It is the consequence of being able to show up, and use every opportunity that life gives me to realize better which are my biases, and who am I really. What do I really bring into the world. The only way to explore those questions is to come out of my comfort zone, and explore them in the wilderness. Out there in the wild. Where people are good, and also bad. Shield myself from what is not helpful, and become in the process. Use every interaction that life offers a tool for deeper exploration, for deeper playing of this game. Learn to recognize the signals. Be there for them and show up. Just show up. That is all that matters. The learning comes from there, and it is more subtle than what I think. The unconscious mind is working on the background, there is no need for me to control that process. But I need to show up, in order to have it up and running.\n\nThat is what this whole game of evolution is about. It is about interacting with the world, getting feedback, and learning how to play the game better. It is giving and taking. It is helping and being helped. On Wednesday I will start a huge adventure in that sense, and I will give my best to stay focused and realize that I have everything that is needed to provide my family with all of what they need. To be free from the burden of dependence from my family in economic terms. And more than that, to have people to believe in what I do, and help them become who they can be. That is my mission here, to shine a light into other people so that they can be the best version of themselves. That is all that matters, and I’m here for that.\n",

Yesterday I had a huge one. I organized an event and very few people showed up, which had me very disappointed throughout the whole event because I felt that I had a responsibility with the person that I invited to be the co-host, and the main responsibility that I felt had with her was an economic one. I thought that because of there being very few people, she would get little money, and her time would not be worth it. And there was also the presence of being a failure in the way that I shared what I was going to do, since I was not able to reach out to people properly through social media. But the persons that participated were amazing, they are the most important people for me in the world, and it was very important to share that vulnerable space with them. My wife and the best friend that I have in the world were there. But yes, my capacity for holding the space was compromised because of me having been thrown out of balance for what I felt in that moment. So I was just feeling those sensations and what was brought up for me, through the whole experience. It was important.\"}),`\n`,(0,o.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And then I went to my parents house, and because of a question that my father made to me (\\u2018How many people were there?\\u2019) I realized that I have a strong subconscious pattern of thought that is related to the amount of people participating in something equalling how good it is. The more, the better. This has been present throughout my life, as I have had a very large group of friends, have gone to travels with a lot of people, always more and more and more. Thinking that more is the key. I sit down to work and I think that the more hours I put in the better, not realizing that there is a subtle aspect that is working that is way beyond this number. Last night I had a conversation with only one friend and it was very important, very profound, very nice. This is what matters, having this type of interaction. It doesn\\u2019t matter with how many people. But it was there, working its way, and yesterday I was able to spot it right on. It was absolutely freeing to be the witness of that process, of that unconscious process. That is what all this game is about, of making the unconscious aspects conscious. And that was a big one. I was able to realize that and become free of it. I don\\u2019t mean that it won\\u2019t be active and I won\\u2019t value my life based on numbers anymore, but at least it is not as present as it was before. And I want to hold space. I want to be there for others. And if I\\u2019m there holding the space being disappointed because no more people showed up, I won\\u2019t be able to do it fully, with all of what I am. And I want to be able to do it fully. So that\\u2019s why it is so important to have realized this, because it will happen again.

To give my best for those who are there, or to blame myself for not having more people in?\nThe answer is clear as water today. And that is what showing up is for. I created this space, I organized something new, that didn\\u2019t exist before, and I showed up for it. I did it because I care. And life answered back with one of the most important realizations that I have had lately, because this is one that constitutes the way on which I work as a human being in society. There is the important concept of traction, and it is impossible to be hosting an event for 100 people from scratch. It is not necessary. What is necessary is to forget about the number, and make it a memorable experience for all of those who are there. For all of those that did show up. My time, their time, is so valuable that it is not worth it to spend it thinking about what could have happened if more people showed up. No, no, no.

So this thing will happen again, and it is going to be very important to be able to realize how the ego is playing his thing, how it is working in those subtle ways so that I can become present with what is in that moment. That is the energy that needs to be moving, and that is the work that I\\u2019m going to do as I move towards the understanding of how to truly hold space for the transformation of others. I need to open up to do more things like this. I need to be there for more people as they transition into a new way of being. And it starts here. It starts in every session that I go through, in every moment that I decide to show up for other people.

          "raw": "\nIt’s my daughter’s first birthday, and what is present in me is this willingness to feel different from what I feel. There is a constant sensation present in me related to not being able to provide myself what I need in order to make the progress that I need to make, and that is bringing noise. A lot of noise. It is time to start doing it, so that I can focus on living, on just being. Until now I have not been able to do it because I have not had clarity on which was the message that I wanted to convey, but now it is time to clarify that and move forward with that clarity. I have everything that I need, I just need to see it with more clarity. And witness what doing this brings to me, what writing brings, and how important it is for me to do it so that I can make better sense of everything that is going on in my life. I have not been able to put in the 4 hours that. I promised myself to do, but being in the extremes is like the pattern of action that I have to recognize so that I can be not identified by it. In my mind, it is 4 hours or nothing. There is no middle ground. And that makes me feel like a failure when I’m not able to put in the 4 hours, and it is time for me to realize that that is also a trick of my mind, something that it plays on me to make me feel bad. You are not that mind. You are not what you think you are. You are not the one that is feeling those sensations of not being alone. You are the one that cares, that just wants to give love to his family. And it is time to do it! And a big way of doing it is providing you the time that you need to free your mind from all of this stuff, and coming to write here is the funnel to which all that noise goes. Writing here makes me feel free, so that I can be more of myself with the ones that matter. The family. There is nothing more important than the family.\n\nSo how does it feel to vomit a bit of words here? Light. An idea showed up, and it was an important one. And there was no delay on the execution of that idea, and it ended up being something great. It worked. And that is the thing, transforming the ideas that the brain generates so that become a reality, and don’t be attached to them. There is an idea related to a concept to play around with in Twitter, and it feels like a great one, and there needs to be an action for transforming that idea into a reality, so that there is information gathered as feedback from the universe. I guess that this whole game is like that, it is understanding how evolution works but in the human level. Understand the game of biology but in the human perspective, as above so below, and realize that information in all levels can be understood as ways of doing, of acting, that can help me better understand what to do. There is information in everything. Everything is actually information, it doesn’t matter where it comes from. I’m going to play with it, and stick with it, so that it becomes a reality. Evolutions plays its games, I was listening to that in the Lex Fridman episode, the last one, and there is a huge amount information in there related to how evolution works, and how it plays its game so that entities can become what they become. AS I try to dive into the understanding of what I have listened from that episode, it is blurry, because it was a lot of information, but what comes is that, it is the exploration into seeing the reality of my life with the lens of evolution. I have said the last two years that I’m in a process of evolution. What does it take for me to evolve? Who am I when I am evolving? What do I do? It is cheaper than ever to gather feedback from the environment, the only thing that it takes is committing to show up and share with the world all of what I am. The simpler the better. So much time spent trying to get it right, to find the best way to do stuff, but there is no such thing as that. There is only actively trying and doing the best to find out what works. And by saying what works I mean it both in a experiential level (within myself) and also in a environmental/societal level (within the outside). How does that doing resonate with the external world, and how does that impact myself and my way of doing things? Why am I doing what I am doing? That is the interesting question to ask. That is the way forward. Why am I doing what I am doing, and what is the impact that it has in the environment? In all parts of the environment. This is what it means to be conscious, be willing to adapt as the understanding of this is refined. AS there is a clearer understanding of this feedback, of this way of doing, of this thing.\n\nThere is a very strong pressure in the forehead, and it has gotten intense since I decided to sit-down and write. It has bee there throughout the morning as I was dealing with the sensations that come up when having the family of my wife in the house. A lot of energy moving, especially related to the ‘give her the presents’ thing. Another thing that my mind is telling me that can be made better in society, which is the way on which we give presents to our children for their birthdays. What could be more meaningful than that? Which is a different way of approaching birthdays? I can’t just criticize without offering a way out. And actually my father offered an amazing way out, which is having given her a picture in a frame. It is a very nice gift. And my mind criticizes him and says that the only reason for him to do it is because it is a picture from the cruise, and he wants to know all the world that he went on a cruise with her granddaughter. And that she was in Turkey and all those things. And that is what my mind tells me, because it is unable to see that he actually cares, and that having gone to the cruise is his own way of expressing what he cares about. It is what he likes doing, it is what he enjoys, and it is ok. Where does the acceptance of this whole thing come from? Where does that anger towards him originate from? It is very much related to the lack of tenderness that I have experiences from him, in a ‘flesh’ level. All his love has been expressed to me with his renunciation of himself to give us everything that we needed. He worked his ass off for that. For being able to go into that cruise, and provide us with what we missed in our childhood. It is time for me to recognize that, and recognize that he will never be the person that I expect him to be. This is what I need to give up, to surrender, so that I can truly feel him for who his is. And appreciate him from who he is. There is an unconscious pattern going on related to me thinking that I will be less valued in society if I love him, because of how shallow he is in my mind. But how can I say that he is shallow, if his whole existence is related to being in service? Isn’t that the deepest expression of love, being in service? And he doesn’t even know that he is like that probably, he just does it. And for me it is harder to accept that, because it is probably something that I aspire to but haven’t been able to transform into a reality. I feel like that with him because I want to be like him. That is the thing. I see him happy, free, and I want to be happy and free. And I’m trapped inside my own mind. Trying to be someone different, expecting to be someone different. But it will never happen, because I am who I am, and I was born in this place because of something. I’m here with him because of something. It is very important for me to acknowledge this in a deep, experiential level, and make that trnasition from judging him to loving him. That is everything I need, make peace with who he is and realize that he is giving his best. He has always been. And so are theater grandparents of my daughter, and my wife, and everyone really. How important it is for me to be able to realize this, and embody it. How needed is to be able to do that work, the one of acceptance, the one of realizing the unconscious patterns that command the way on which I behave and from there truly evolve. That is the truth. Facing all the truth of my existence, with all of what it brings. Wherever there is separation, wherever there is an underlying tension inside a way that I have of relating to another, that is pure information that can be helpful for my process of evolution. And that will only happen if I’m able to face that fact, and realize that is will be always present if I’m not able to face it with all what I have. Face the truth and realize that I am that truth. Face that truth until it fades away, because it is not true. It is not true that I am separated from them, what is true is that I am the same as them, more than anything. I am the same as them, and they are my parents. It is time for me to embrace that, and that is the biggest present that I can make to my young daughter. Realizing the huge game that being a parent is, and accept everything that they are so that I can integrate who I am also. I am also a parent that lacks certain things, and in this day it is important to face that so that I can evolve who I am. By accepting what I have done. And being in peace with that.\n\nToday is the anniversary of me becoming a father, and this is the moment when I see myself at the mirror and step down to realize all that has happened in the last years of my life. It is so easy to be caught up on the train, but this is the moment on which I stop to acknowledge the effort to become. To evolve. In so many different areas, and my daughter is a consequence of that. I have not done it perfectly, I have made mistakes, and it has been how it has been, but there is a ever present willingness to be, and that is what sinks into her. She just is, a little bit more than us, a little bit more present. She is the one that I’m paving the road for. For all of those that are being born now, and that will inhabit the world of the future. They will build the world of the future, and if I do my due diligence, I will be paving it for her, for sure. It is just like that, that is the game, and there is nothing else that matters. The only important thing is to realize that the game is played here, today, with my family, with those that will be present and that are the most important human beings in my life and in the one of my little Mila. It is about being present for her. Today is what all the training was for. For leaving the judgements behind, for leaving the willingness to change them behind, and just be. Just be with all of who each of them is, trying to connect with what is deep behind their words, their actions. Being with the part of them that cares, that just is. All what I have done is training for this moment. To enjoy them as much as I can, and realize that all the parts of me that experience separation are something that is built through my experience because of something that I don’t accept in myself. That is the note to myself: Each part of them that I don’t see is an aspect of myself that I don’t want to see also. Each part of them that I judge is a part of myself that I judge. Have that in mind, and use all that as the means for just enjoying, for just enjoying that it is one year since Mila.\n",

So much time spent trying to get it right, to find the best way to do stuff, but there is no such thing as that. There is only actively trying and doing the best to find out what works. And by saying what works I mean it both in a experiential level (within myself) and also in a environmental/societal level (within the outside). How does that doing resonate with the external world, and how does that impact myself and my way of doing things? Why am I doing what I am doing? That is the interesting question to ask. That is the way forward. Why am I doing what I am doing, and what is the impact that it has in the environment? In all parts of the environment. This is what it means to be conscious, be willing to adapt as the understanding of this is refined. AS there is a clearer understanding of this feedback, of this way of doing, of this thing.\"}),`\n`,(0,a.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"There is a very strong pressure in the forehead, and it has gotten intense since I decided to sit-down and write. It has bee there throughout the morning as I was dealing with the sensations that come up when having the family of my wife in the house. A lot of energy moving, especially related to the \\u2018give her the presents\\u2019 thing. Another thing that my mind is telling me that can be made better in society, which is the way on which we give presents to our children for their birthdays. What could be more meaningful than that? Which is a different way of approaching birthdays? I can\\u2019t just criticize without offering a way out. And actually my father offered an amazing way out, which is having given her a picture in a frame. It is a very nice gift. And my mind criticizes him and says that the only reason for him to do it is because it is a picture from the cruise, and he wants to know all the world that he went on a cruise with her granddaughter. And that she was in Turkey and all those things. And that is what my mind tells me, because it is unable to see that he actually cares, and that having gone to the cruise is his own way of expressing what he cares about. It is what he likes doing, it is what he enjoys, and it is ok. Where does the acceptance of this whole thing come from? Where does that anger towards him originate from? It is very much related to the lack of tenderness that I have experiences from him, in a \\u2018flesh\\u2019 level. All his love has been expressed to me with his renunciation of himself to give us everything that we needed. He worked his ass off for that. For being able to go into that cruise, and provide us with what we missed in our childhood. It is time for me to recognize that, and recognize that he will never be the person that I expect him to be. This is what I need to give up, to surrender, so that I can truly feel him for who his is. And appreciate him from who he is. There is an unconscious pattern going on related to me thinking that I will be less valued in society if I love him, because of how shallow he is in my mind. But how can I say that he is shallow, if his whole existence is related to being in service? Isn\\u2019t that the deepest expression of love, being in service? And he doesn\\u2019t even know that he is like that probably, he just does it. And for me it is harder to accept that, because it is probably something that I aspire to but haven\\u2019t been able to transform into a reality. I feel like that with him because I want to be like him. That is the thing. I see him happy, free, and I want to be happy and free. And I\\u2019m trapped inside my own mind. Trying to be someone different, expecting to be someone different. But it will never happen, because I am who I am, and I was born in this place because of something. I\\u2019m here with him because of something. It is very important for me to acknowledge this in a deep, experiential level, and make that trnasition from judging him to loving him. That is everything I need, make peace with who he is and realize that he is giving his best. He has always been. And so are theater grandparents of my daughter, and my wife, and everyone really. How important it is for me to be able to realize this, and embody it. How needed is to be able to do that work, the one of acceptance, the one of realizing the unconscious patterns that command the way on which I behave and from there truly evolve. That is the truth. Facing all the truth of my existence, with all of what it brings. Wherever there is separation, wherever there is an underlying tension inside a way that I have of relating to another, that is pure information that can be helpful for my process of evolution. And that will only happen if I\\u2019m able to face that fact, and realize that is will be always present if I\\u2019m not able to face it with all what I have. Face the truth and realize that I am that truth. Face that truth until it fades away, because it is not true. It is not true that I am separated from them, what is true is that I am the same as them, more than anything. I am the same as them, and they are my parents. It is time for me to embrace that, and that is the biggest present that I can make to my young daughter. Realizing the huge game that being a parent is, and accept everything that they are so that I can integrate who I am also. I am also a parent that lacks certain things, and in this day it is important to face that so that I can evolve who I am. By accepting what I have done. And being in peace with that.\"}),`\n`,(0,a.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Today is the anniversary of me becoming a father, and this is the moment when I see myself at the mirror and step down to realize all that has happened in the last years of my life. It is so easy to be caught up on the train, but this is the moment on which I stop to acknowledge the effort to become. To evolve. In so many different areas, and my daughter is a consequence of that. I have not done it perfectly, I have made mistakes, and it has been how it has been, but there is a ever present willingness to be, and that is what sinks into her. She just is, a little bit more than us, a little bit more present. She is the one that I\\u2019m paving the road for. For all of those that are being born now, and that will inhabit the world of the future. They will build the world of the future, and if I do my due diligence, I will be paving it for her, for sure. It is just like that, that is the game, and there is nothing else that matters. The only important thing is to realize that the game is played here, today, with my family, with those that will be present and that are the most important human beings in my life and in the one of my little Mila. It is about being present for her. Today is what all the training was for. For leaving the judgements behind, for leaving the willingness to change them behind, and just be. Just be with all of who each of them is, trying to connect with what is deep behind their words, their actions. Being with the part of them that cares, that just is. All what I have done is training for this moment. To enjoy them as much as I can, and realize that all the parts of me that experience separation are something that is built through my experience because of something that I don\\u2019t accept in myself. That is the note to myself: Each part of them that I don\\u2019t see is an aspect of myself that I don\\u2019t want to see also. Each part of them that I judge is a part of myself that I judge. Have that in mind, and use all that as the means for just enjoying, for just enjoying that it is one year since Mila.\"})]})}function v(t={}){let{wrapper:e}=t.components||{};return e?(0,a.jsx)(e,Object.assign({},t,{children:(0,a.jsx)(l,t)})):l(t)}var k=v;return p(j);})();\n;return Component;"
